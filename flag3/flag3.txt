I am fairly close. I am past the teapot error and I am able to get an LDAP request with the redirect, however its never hitting the python web server that is serving my Exploit.class. I can browse to the Exploit.class file. I can click the link in the Terminal "Send LDAP reference result for redirecting to LINK" < I can click this. 


Is there any reason why the web server won't redirect and pull down my exploit?

I am a bit confused as the hint "R rated cartoons are not exploitable." is throwing me off since I am not sure if the outlier I found is the correct one or not, and this is unrelated to any R rating on the cartoon list, but a cartoon with an outlier just happens to share this with it. So I am wondering if that means not to use that cartoon?


Reply

Sorry, the reason we specified is because the R rated cartoon is hard coded, so we didn't want to waste your time trying to exploit one that is not exploitable.

Ah okay, so just to confirm, the R rated cartoon has nothing to do with successfully getting the flag? I am wondering as many hints on the thread have all led to that cartoon, unless I am overlooking another one currently.

Thank you! So are the hints referring to something much more niche? It is just hard for me to really use the hints that have been provided unless they are referring to something extremely obscure with some of the cartoons listed haha. Also, how much value should be placed on the last screenshot in the instructions page for this flag? Looking at it, it seems like it reveals quite a bit, but I am not sure if it is purely examples sake.

No, the first hint is to let you know if you get errors about exploiting, that you likely are in the right spot. The 2nd probably is better as disclosure not a hint. 

It is purely just an example as to what you should see when you get your flag. Let me ask you this, do you have the attack vector yet?

Ahh that clears it up thank you. 

And I do not believe I have the vector, I am also not 100% sure what the vector should exactly be. I have an idea, but I am not sure exactly. If it isn't revealing too much, feel free to redact, but I feel the attack vector is the network aspect of the cartoons. Even if it is not the R rated cartoon, perhaps that cartoon was separate from the rest for an example of what the vector should be for the proper cartoon?

I finally passed the teapot error and can see connections being made to the servers - but am not able to get the rating to update, I found some references on stack overflow (copying if it will help others - java - Updating property value in properties file without deleting other values - Stack Overflow) and my code is almost identical but can't quite figure out where I'm going wrong? Short of looking at the code I know there isn't much to go off here - but was wondering if there were some common issues you have noticed in exploit files?

So I think you need to make sure you are writing all of the properties back to the file. You can do that by printing out the contents in your java code. I also noticed that you are creating a path for the file and you shouldn't do that. The file path is just in the project root which is the top level directory of the application NOT /root if that makes sense?

You can test out how you are writing properties a lot easier locally creating a quick and dirty java program and running it. That is going to be significantly easier to debug than in a distributed, exploited application.

I am at the point where I can inject the exploit script to the target with HTTP 200 responses, confirming the injecting. I tried multiple ways to update the config properties file, and it is currently being overwritten by the system. Perhaps, I need to look for other vectors, and any resource or tips to identifying the different method?

1. HTTP 200 responses does not necessarily mean that you're actually injecting the trigger. Look for logs you've written in your java code or look at the terminals for the python and ldap servers to confirm that they are, in fact, retrieving and executing your Java.

2. Use Java to write to the file. Don't get complicated with trying to execute shell instructions from the Java code

In the logs the only thing I see that is not set is the same place as what was not set for flag 1 and 2. I used my exploit there to print out hello world in the logs and that does happen. 
Is this the attack vector or is there something else out there ? This is just not making sense.

Teapot messages imply that there was not enough encoding involved and that the server managed to detect your lookup in the end. Keep trying! 

As for 500 errors.... Hard to tell to be honest. You could using that the server geniunely does not know but the syntax is correct client side. Keep going!

I got to the point where I see the teapot message then tried obfuscating using encoding techniques and now just get the original output of the details of the cartoon given the cartoon id I am using in my curl. I tried a different way of obfuscation and I get the same original output about the cartoon I choose for the curl. Each time, I see the mystery attack vector set with the injection I attempted when I look at the logs. Does this mean my obfuscation is wrong or it's my java code?

Do you see your LDAP and python server getting triggered? If yes, then it's an issue with the Java code. Otherwise it's an issue with your obfuscation/jndi syntax.

Well, I've got the teapot. I've experimented with a great many methods of obfuscating the arguments with no luck. I can get all the individual parts but haven't yet been able to compose the full string. It seems that I can't nest braces - or at least I get a 400 when I try. Should I be able to do that?

You might need to encode the braces.

I've tried the usual urlencoding but that doesn't seem to work. Instead of interpreting the thing I'm passing in, once I nest even encoded braces, Nothing is interpreted.

I wonder if this means I'm using the wrong vector.

Or maybe I just need to be more inventive about encoding and obfuscating.

Have you tried putting the original curl command directly in browser, or using encodeURIComponent, and use the encoded part for the value of your parameter? Also, ensure your exploit file and flow are correct.

 Replying to Le Tao
I haven't actually been able to trigger the exploit since I haven't been able to pass in the jndi-related string I want the server to interpret. I can compose strings which are interpreted, eg env commands or the java version.

But when I try with the thing which I think should interpret to the jndi command I want - which takes nested braces - it stops interpreting the string and just shows it verbatim in the log. I get 400 errors when I try with actual curly braces and the non-interpretation when I use url-encoded (ie what I would get from encodeURIComponent()).

I'll lay it down for a bit and then come back and attack it anew.

This parameter is different, it shows up in the log. We learned from the previous flags how JNDI LDAP can be exploited, how it makes the exploit file effective, so we use that insight to build the new payload (parameter plus encoding, as well as the logic of exploit file). And I experienced that too. Take a break, maybe walk dog or else, and then check the flag again. You might notice something new in the log when coming back.

TA already gives many hints including this one:

Hello Everyone, 
AFter struggling for this for quiet a while (tried moving forward but somehow the concepts seems connected ) 
I am back at my question as to what do we mean by Attack Vector, 
From Flag 1 and 2 the place where we place our jndi to trigger the java code and eventually condirm the injection using the ldap server was pretty straightforward .

Coming onto flag 3 I see many references and hints but the only thing that seems out of place when calling for the entire cartoon list is set pretty obvious in one of the entries of the cartoons. 

Im pretty sure i have to use the id of that particular entry to trigger something as was pointed out within the logs . 
now how does attack vector comes into play to send in my jndi is beyond me right now. I tries using a query logic and what not and still coming into some dead end or another and the LDAP server not confirming if the inject was successful or not . 

Ik the way we inject is going to be diff than the flag2

Please any help i greatly appreciate it !

The attack vector is not based on any trivia that you are expected to know. Take a closer look at what gets logged when you call those endpoints and see if you can find an out of place variable in the logs that can be used as an attack vector.

Hey Gantabya, just like before in the API sec project and google what you see is out-of-place and trust your gut.

I only took 4 hours on this flag. The comments had me worried but there are some real nuggets in here. Some tips that helped me and have been shared here:

Know your attack vector (and what that means). There's a couple comments in here that should point you in the right path.

Some people use curl and some people use Postman... do what's comfortable.

This is a very helpful article: https://bishopfox.com/blog/identify-and-exploit-log4shell some people recommend trying some obfuscation methods sparingly by testing it on each letter one-by-one... I ended up going all out on one method once I could verify it was interpreted properly in smaller tests. Helpful comment here: https://edstem.org/us/courses/69023/discussion/6222709?comment=14492417 

A tool we used on at least two projects came in handy for the encoding part. I might as well bookmark it at this point!

make sure to read the instructions :)

Last but not least, whoever came up with this list of cartoons has great taste! These are all of my favorites to this day. Just need to add American Dad and The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy lol

It is referencing a cartoon :( INSTANT FAIL! ha just kidding.

I guess I am using the second curl call since it looked like in the write up the second call actually retrieved the flag, and checked if the value remained and wasn't being reset. Second call has nothing to do with the Exploit, just validation the value was retained.  

Just to validate the cartoon is spy oriented? 

Correct in the cartoon reference. Able to bypass and even see my GTID in the value for rating. Even when I establish the remote connection I can see that my rating is present in the properties file. But no flag. 

Edit: Got it!! Make sure when modifying the file you are not removing other values when setting the rating. When I checked the file again noticed some items were missing.

Alright so taking a look back, I'm just wondering what could be the 'out-of-place' looking attack vector. Looking at the list of cartoons, I believe I have a good idea as to what the attack vector is, but I am not sure if its that easy. As a cartoon nerd myself, will it be a 'if you know, you know' moment, in addition to what looks out of place? 

EDIT: GOT PASSED THE TEAPOT! But it seems the problem isn't so short and stout as I thought (pun fully intended. lol )

I assume this is where we start injecting our id for the rating according to the writeup? I'll reread just in case I missed something.


Edit: Just checked out Denis's comment. Definetly not as easy as I thought, but I see some other fields in addition to the one we used back in flag1 and flag2.

So it seems that the points of attack are still null so I will assume that they are not changeable. Trying to think what else I can.

I remember that our approach has to be different how it was from flag 2. 

Does this means we do not have to worry servers communicating with each other this time?

EDIT: OKAY So I did research on the supposed out-of-place thing and it indeed does relate to a spy-thing. 

In a way, it is out-of-place but its still remaining null for some reason.. Any other ways to address this?

EDIT: Something tells me we shouldn't be performing a lookup with an ip but instead, with the config.properties. The writeup mentions that is our target but am I on the right track? But then we would have no way to fire our exploit.. If anyone has an idea, it would be very appreciated.

EDIT: To further add on to my findings, just as Kevin mentioned, if your java system.out print statements are not coming through on your log, it means that your file is not being fired.. Question is though, how we can fire through that point of attack. I won't lie it keeps showing as null despite matching the name of it and I've obfuscated properly as I am not seeing the teapot message. Any ideas?

EDIT: I got communication from my Python Server and marshalsec server again but nothing is firing. Goin check my java file.

EDIT: I'm able to reverse-shell connect into our target, I can see what we need to change but just like what the hint and other comments say, the file changes back to normal. Gotta figure that out somehow..

You need to tail the console.log file to see System.out.println messages. If you still don't see it, then it's likely that your exploit is not running.

Hi,

I'm able to do a Curl using an "out of place vector" variable, and I was able to encode the LDAP JNDI query in the url so that it bypasses the JNDI teapot message, the response is also coming back.

My console log has the exploit in the attack vector I used using query params.

I'm still not receiving any request on my LDAP server.

Note that I did get past the JNDI teapot message using encoding and I'm using query params approach.

Please let me know if I'm on the right direction.

There are multiple approaches to obfuscation/encoding. I would recommend trying quite a few and go with which one makes the most sense to you. It's hard to say which one, as some will click differently for different students. You can copy/paste your string substitutions or encodings into online tools to help validate them .

Not sure if i am picking the wrong vector. When ever I tried to include "/", either directly or encoded, the server returned 404 response. I think I am not sending my .class to the log since I even don't see my print() logged. Completed flag 4&5 and come back for flag2 but still no progress on sending malicious payload.

Found flag5 quite similar to this flag in terms of how to craft the malicious java code but definitely the true difficulty I found in this flag is how to send it to server.

Not sure if I have the right logic here:

Logs indicate the order how the system processes and I need to inject my malicious script to the spot after where the system may potentially reset my work and before where value check takes place.

So just testing the variable I have, I think it is the right one (reminds me of a good action movie)? I am able to add in content just to see if I can pass it through, I can, when I try to put my jndi in there, I see the teapot message - realize there needs to be obfuscation and I just can't seem to find the right type. However, I see mentions of other headers? I guess I am just getting a bit caught, up is there a variable and header needed, or just the GATECH id header?

I am able to get my exploit to run by obfuscating the parameter at the place where I receive the teapot message. I know that my exploit is working correctly because I can see print statements I added to verify the operation in the console log. At the time of the exploit's operation, the config file has the correct contents.



Now it returns a 404 and it still looks like the config file is reset after my exploit runs. It seems that this vector isn't the correct one based on the 404, the timing of the reset, and the redacted screenshot from the write-up.

I have also tried all vectors similar to Flag 2 with no results.

I see an out of place variable which is the same as a field in one of the records, but I do not understand its relevance or how it would even be accessed.

Am I going in the right direction? Are all of my assumptions here correct? I feel like I have exhausted every option.

Edit: For anyone else having similar issues, I was on the right track after all, but I was looking at the wrong variable. This was the correct endpoint, but the placement of the string was in the wrong part of the request.

Important to identify the correct vector first, this can be achieved by reading through the logs generated when you call the endpoint

Hint: Someone might have tried to roll their own patch and tried to deny requests containing malicious string patterns. 

It is important to apply and test what you have learnt thus far before you attempt to perform any transformation on your end. I found it helpful to test using methods I learnt in Flag 1 and 2 as well

I would really recommend query params for your research and read up

Do approach this step by step make sure the methods learnt in the article works first before you attempt any forms of transformation to avoid the issue you are having now

Have you identified the correct out of place variable/vector? It is important to do so to trigger the exploit. I recommend reading the generated logs when you call the endpoint to identify it

To also add on, as we are working with remote program that contains its own logic and flow it is important to understand the flow of the program of what it is doing and processing to identify the correct out of place variable/vector to trigger your exploit code by reading the logs it generates.

Lastly, in case you missed this hint Hint: R rated cartoons are not exploitable.

You should check the logs for an out of place vector/variable and confirm if the attack vector you are using now is correct. 

You might want to confirm it as your exploit code is not running.

Whether your exploit code runs or not depends on your curl command as well.

My advice would be to do the following:
1. Confirm you have the correct vector by analysing the logs
2. You may actually used methods from the previous flags just to test and see if your exploit code is running as expected, just to cover that it is working before you start designing your curl to start the exploit
3. After you have covered the above, you are almost there and you just need to draft your curl in a proper syntax to trigger your exploit code. Do read up in query params and how it is used.

Hope the above helps! Good luck!

If the exploit is running that’s one step down, you managed to verify your code is working as expected.

To be clear, we need to use this resource to figure out how to call the exploit endpoint without using headers like in flag 2? We need to call the exploit using query parameters  of the endpoint that accepts them and apply knowledge in this resource to pass it properly? 


Just wanted to confirm since I haven't had any success with calling through query parameters but maybe I'm going down the wrong path and it really is as simple as using headers (since I have been able to execute the exploit this way) despite the many hints that we should go a different route from flag 2.

Just got the flag. Maybe I'm just obtuse, but a lot of these comments misled me. I was second guessing the attack vector I thought was somewhat obvious after I discovered it because my interpretation of some of the hints made me think that since it was located after the "Reading properties file" code, it was invalid and wouldn't do what I wanted it to do. But sure enough...it worked. Maybe there are multiple vectors here that can accomplish the task? Not sure. 

So to echo some other hints I found helpful, pay attention to anything in the logs that looks like a variable that isn't being properly assigned with a value. Once you find something that looks suspicious, what helped me was simply injecting a test string value to see if it would let me change it. Then use that variable as a way to carry out your exploit.

Can you expand on why this would happen? My payload is printing perfectly, where it should be, but it's not actually calling my java file (even though that payload calls the file and changes the properties when it's at the other attack point that won't work for this flag)


Edit: I figured out my problem. If you have the same problem as me, try and see if there is a difference between what's printed at your attack vector/variable and what gets printed at the attack vector higher up. For some reason a piece was left off in the final version and I had to basically write it twice.

Am I understanding this flag correctly that I am looking for some variable/attack vector, and once I find it, the Curl command is sanitized such that we need to encode/obfuscate the call to our exploit script, and that the encoding/obfucation mechanism that will work is shown as an example somewhere in the linked reference materials? 

If that all sounds correct so far, can someone narrow it down as to which linked reference material would be useful for this flag, because I feel like I have tried every encoding/obfucation mechanism I can find in any of those articles/videos and haven't had any success yet.

OK, I've been at this for the last 2 days and am at a loss. I'm confident I found the correct attack vector (as evidenced by some of the tips below), I'm reaching the server and can use a similar technique to get a reverse shell (just to prove redirection), and I believe I have the correct library because running something similar within the reverse shell environment manually will overwrite the rating as intended. Yet, running my java file under the same scenario always results in a failure. Any tips on what else I could possibly be missing?

If you are going down the same route as flag 2 (Using exec) we have found over the past semesters this is significantly harder than it needs to be to get it to work. Even when it works locally in the bash terminal. 

IF SO, then I recommend looking into the java standard library classes for reading and writing files. 

IF NOT, and you are using the java stdlib way, it could be your attack vector is wrong, obfuscation is wrong etc.

Thanks for the reply. I'm not using the same tactics as flag 2 and have tried what feels like a dozen different Java standard libraries for R/W, so I went back to the attack vector/obfuscation and feel I've disproven those as the issue because nothing else triggers the 200 message on my python server. Anything else obvious I could try, or should I just put this one down and come back to it?

Hmm, well if that is the case I would make sure that your read/writes work as you are expecting. You can do this via flag 2, since you already have that working. If you are able to create a file via flag 2, then your injection is likely wrong. Pay close attention to IP's/Ports

I noticed that the update to config.properties happened before the reset files operation, which caused the update to the rating property to fail. Could this be due to using the same approach as in Flag2, where I injected a malicious JNDI lookup payload into the HTTP request header? Should I explore a different method to reach the LDAP server?

Okay, that's really helpful. And the hint to what attack vector (whatever that means?) we should be using is located somewhere in the log output of the curl command found in the instructions:

curl 'http://localhost:8080/rest/cartoons/cartoonList' -H 'GATECH_ID:123456789'  


There is also a mystery variable that is located somewhere that is integral to solving this problem by using it in an unspecified way.

That's what I've gathered from other posts here. Is that correct? Does anyone have any advice because at this point I'm feeling aimless.

The config.properties file is located in the root directory of the application, so you don't need to specify a full path to access it. You also don't need to do any directory traversal or complex file operations - just refer to "config.properties" directly.

I need some clarification on the instructions here, as I'm getting some conflicting guidance. In the Flag 3 instructions, it states the following:

"For this exploit, you will use the log4j exploit to update the “config.properties” file saved in the root directory of the application. This properties file contains a property that will set the rating for all of the children’s cartoons."

However, in the code response, it states the following:

"the rating property is not in config.properties, you are using the wrong attack vector (Look for one that is out of place ;)) ie - the properties file is being reset after your exploit, OR overwriting file instead of updating it."

Can I get some clarity on this? Is it the rating property in config.properties or is it not? This is sending me in a circle.

It is in the config.properties file and you need to overwrite it with you exploit. This error message is just there to help you debug. It doesn't necessarily mean you didn't set the property, just something to look for.

My failure was because of the java script. If you are executing the exploit on the found path param, as stated by the TA, but you are still not getting the flag even though your script works, then try another java library to modify the file. I wasted a lot of time because of this.

Hm I don`t know what I can say and what not. Look at the log output in Task 2 before you exploited it and then look at the output for Task 3. There should be another attack vector/variable in the task3 logs. Maybe you can also run your code with the attack vector from task2 and print out all the steps. Then you should see what the problems is and where you code need to run. This was then the hardest step for me to find out how I can modify the attack vector.

It is triggering multiple times because of your obfuscation. Each ones resolves to it's own lookup. That is to be expected. 

That is very possible. The application logs when it reads in the properties. You should exploit BEFORE that message. It could be you have the wrong attack vector and it already has the properties in state.

Hello,

I've found the out of place vector, bypassed the detection mechanism and I get RCE. I'm able to modify the config file and change the property that will set the rating while keeping all of the other fields the same. The endpoint then returns the non-R rated cartoon with all the same data except the rating is changed to my gatech ID. Why does this not trigger the flag? Obviously I've missed something. 

I see that the endpoint reads the unmodified config file twice before my payload runs, then my payload modifies the config file. Lastly, I see the "Flag not obtained due to failed attempt, ... " message.

Lastly lastly, one last clarification:

My exploit reads the whole config file, and writes all of it back into the same file except it changes the rating field to my gatech ID. Is this "overwriting" and not "updating"? Is there a method to only update one line of a file in Java?


Thank you!

Ah, based on what you have said here is I think you are exploiting AFTER the application reads in the properties. If so, you need to look for another attack vector earlier on in the program flow. 


What you are doing with your exploit is correct. You can do it the way you are just make sure the other properties are untouched ie - the same strings.

 In real-world scenarios with Log4j, regardless of which attack vector is used, once the payload is executed, the result will be the same. For example, it doesn’t matter if the exploit is placed in header A or header B in the HTTP request; the outcome should be identical.  Is this the same case for the project, or do I need to focus on a specific attack vector?

 I am currently using the same attack vector as flag2 to pass the exploit, and I can confirm through both the LDAP and web servers that the payload has been triggered. but i am still not able to update the file.

I was able to use the same kind of protocol as in the prior flag.

Ah yes, I didn't make it that far in the video, but it's clever! Thanks so much.

I already where able to bypass that and able to send exploits through the "out of place" variable but I am still not able to change the properties file. It's the only thing left

I am not familiar with Java, so I had to look up ways we can interact with the properties file.

Got it! I tried that on the past but wasn't working. Then I look for a different way to do it and worked so appreciate it!

Where should be such a variable. I looked through the whole logs.

I haven't solved the flag yet, but there's a variable output in the logs and you can see based on its output that it hasn't been set yet. When setting it, I'd consider other ways that we've set variables in other assignments using HTTP requests.
