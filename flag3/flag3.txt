I don't understand this other "attack vector" people are mentioning. What is this?

I recommend restarting the application and calling it as instructed in the write up without exploiting. Then go line by line through the logs to find it. We cannot give this to you as it is part of the task.

I believe I'm on the right track now, but even with my  ID inserted into the rating I am not getting a flag. I've restarted everything

I`m completely stuck with this task. I has no idea how to update the file with this attack vector. Is there any source which help? I can execute my file but don't know how to use the variable I found. Is there any source which might help Here?

So to be clear all things are adressed but I use the wrong variable and cannot access the right one :( Have no clue how to adress this

So, have you found the attack vector? That is the first step. If you have, you need to then research how query parameters and path parameters work and try to pass any plain string into it, until you find the right one. 


If you have not found the attack vector, I recommend calling the application as instructed in the write up without exploiting and go line by line looking for something out of place.

I found the correct attack vector but I am stuck on formatting and syntax and am not sure where to look.  I don't see how you can populate the variable with the exploit and get around the systems jndi lookup checks in curl without using nested braces, which curl keeps throwing an error at me.

Has anyone been able to see their log statements from their java file? I have System.out.println all over my java file and I'm running a tail on console.log but I've never been able to see my statements. Both console.log and cs6035.log show the same thing pretty much.  I know my files are being triggered from getting flag 2 and seeing the server get requests. Any help would be appreciated as it makes debugging very difficult.

Can you confirm you java file is being triggered? IE - are your ldap and your python server's both firing? If not, then your not seeing the print statements due to the exploit not running. It seems like you are saying they are but if you are doing what you did for flag 2 - ie getting a reverse shell, then you are not going about this flag correctly.

So is modifying the config.properties file at all, the wrong path? Instead we need to use a variable from the logs? So we need the java exploit to modify the logged variable?

You need to use log4shell to trigger your java file to update the config.properties file, if that makes sense?

For some reason it is triggered 18 times, and I am printing the output and I know the value is changed. However, I guess it is changed too early? I viewed the config file, there are only 3 key value pairs. I am only changing the rating.

It is triggering multiple times because of your obfuscation. Each ones resolves to it's own lookup. That is to be expected. 

That is very possible. The application logs when it reads in the properties. You should exploit BEFORE that message. It could be you have the wrong attack vector and it already has the properties in state.

Hello,

I've found the out of place vector, bypassed the detection mechanism and I get RCE. I'm able to modify the config file and change the property that will set the rating while keeping all of the other fields the same. The endpoint then returns the non-R rated cartoon with all the same data except the rating is changed to my gatech ID. Why does this not trigger the flag? Obviously I've missed something. 

I see that the endpoint reads the unmodified config file twice before my payload runs, then my payload modifies the config file. Lastly, I see the "Flag not obtained due to failed attempt, ... " message.

Lastly lastly, one last clarification:

My exploit reads the whole config file, and writes all of it back into the same file except it changes the rating field to my gatech ID. Is this "overwriting" and not "updating"? Is there a method to only update one line of a file in Java?


Thank you!

Ah, based on what you have said here is I think you are exploiting AFTER the application reads in the properties. If so, you need to look for another attack vector earlier on in the program flow. 


What you are doing with your exploit is correct. You can do it the way you are just make sure the other properties are untouched ie - the same strings.

I<REDACTED> I'm very certain that I have the correct exploit location. I'll create a private post with my payload and trigger script.

This is expected. You will need to learn how to obfuscate or encode your payload to bypass this filter.

 In real-world scenarios with Log4j, regardless of which attack vector is used, once the payload is executed, the result will be the same. For example, it doesn’t matter if the exploit is placed in header A or header B in the HTTP request; the outcome should be identical.  Is this the same case for the project, or do I need to focus on a specific attack vector?

 I am currently using the same attack vector as flag2 to pass the exploit, and I can confirm through both the LDAP and web servers that the payload has been triggered. but i am still not able to update the file.

In this project, we aim to exploit different parts of the application, so the attack vectors vary for each flag. Although a Log4j payload produces the same effect once executed, different parts of the application log data in unique ways, creating different points of attack.

Thanks, i was going to the wrong direction.

I am not English native, does below mean we can not modify the file directly? 

One thing to keep in mind is that the application checks to see if this file has been tampered with. You will need to make sure you don’t overwrite the file and instead just update it. This means, all properties need to be as they were except the one you updated.

I am bit confused. I am trying to hit the exploit.java file which I was able to process for Flag 2 but for Flag3, 

Do we need to find an appropriate header to get to run exploit file?

Can we use the same endpoint and header that we used for flag2, making sure the http server is in correct folder?

I see this image in the instructions, is there something in the red circle that is purposefully blacked out, want a TA to confirm this? Thanks!

You will need to find an appropriate place to run the exploit (similar to flag 2), look through the logs to find one.


The endpoint is in the instructions

Each flag has its specific endpoint(s) provided in the writeup that you need to exploit. 

Yes, that is purposefully blacked out to hide the solution :)

Yes. You would need to specify a valid lookup protocol such as LDAP in the JNDI lookup and direct the Log4J lookup to your Exploit file.

[Log4jUtilities.java:32] INFO   Reset files.
I am not understanding the concept of updating. It says that we are not suppose to overwrite the file only change the rating, I am doing that but then it reset the file so I don't get how are we suppose to do it if the file is being reset it. Already bypassed the filter for the vuln but can someone explain the meaning of updating the properties file :)

thanks

If the file is getting reset, then you're probably not attacking at the right place. Look closely at the logs and try to find an out of place variable, then see if you can use it to craft your attack.

I'm in a slightly different boat where I found the exploitable variable and have been able to pass it values, but it takes the values pretty literally. For example, if I pass it ${prefix:name} it will output $prefix:name and not any resolved values.

If you are hitting an error where the server denies your exploit due to detecting malicious patterns, I suggest looking into the shared video as a place to start looking into what kind of solutions there are.
