This didn't email properly the first time sorry if you get two emails.

If you have questions about installation, ask them here.
If you have questions about running or using the VM, please use the #10  VM Troubleshooting thread to keep things in one place, thanks.

#10 -- Before you ask a question, have you looked at our VM Troubleshooting page on the course website?

https://github.gatech.edu/pages/cs6035-tools/cs6035-tools.github.io/RequiredReading/VMTrouble.html

We are releasing the course VM ahead of the Machine Learning project to ensure that everyone has a chance to download it and test that they can boot the VM prior to the release of the first VM based project.

To be SURE, you don't need the VM for the Machine Learning (ML) project, it's optional. 
The ML project has you install a conda environment on your host machine, if that's OK with you then we recommend you do the project on your host. If you don't want to install the conda python environment on your host, you can use the VM. Please look for the VM-specific setup instructions if you plan to use the VM.

You will need the VM for Binary Exploitation and all the rest of our projects except Cryptography, which can be done on your host machine.

---

VM Download link: https://cs6035.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/CS6035-Spring-2025-RC-03.ova

The VM requires VirtualBox 7.1.4 or higher and we always recommend that you use the latest version. VirtualBox downloads are here.

Please note, on Windows during installation of VirtualBox, you'll get a message about installing a Python library, you can skip that.

You are welcome to attempt to use VMWare products, Parallels, or any other hypervisor of your choice but we cannot provide help in troubleshooting for anything other than VirtualBox.

---

(James' note: If you have issues with VirtualBox on an Intel-based Mac, don't waste time troubleshooting, just use VMWare. We can't provide support for VMWare but IN MY OPINION it runs better on Intel-based Macs. Fusion Pro is free for personal/educational use (so is Workstation).

It's also possible to emulate the VM on ARM-based Macs per #11. Our TA Eric Johnson has provided some details on how he configures the emulation. 

Understand that these instructions come without any warranty - we cannot grant extensions due to emulation issues.

Hi team,

how can we "fit the screen" (not sure if it's the right term) of the VM to match my laptop's window size and font settings ? Aside from me manually adusting them after launch can we configure virtualbox to do it auto ? 

Thank you.

Easiest way is once you get to the login screen, right click on the bottom right of the VM buton toolbar (the one that looks like a monitor with a square in it - 6th one from the left below)


Then highlight over the Virtual Screen 1 menu popup and choose what you want to Resize it to


You have to do this each time, but easier than logging in and doing in

Not sure whats not supported since the virtual box i installed is recent.

It is because you have an ARM (M chipset) Mac, which isn't supported. Intel chipset and Virtualbox is what is supported. You can attempt to use your M1 Mac (again, not supported) by following the steps provided in the following post https://edstem.org/us/courses/69023/discussion/5777922

It seems a little slow to me, normally I can download it in less than a few minutes. 

But 25 minutes is still reasonable.


By the way make sure you realize, you don't need the VM for the ML project.

Looks like the VM is configured to forward port 22 (SSH). Running on Linux and and have an sshd already running.

Is this forward a requirement or can I just move the port forward to a different external port?


Reply

Dustin Sellers

You can move it or if your machine is equipped (resources) to run the VM (GUI), you don't need it. It is there by default to allow students who have issues running via the VM GUI


Reply

James J Lohse

also FWIW the port forwarding is a VirtualBox setting, not inherent to the VM. The vm just knows that OpenSSL is running on port 22, VirtualBox port forwarding is where you choose what local port will forward to port 22 on the vm. 

Somehow the OVA has this virtualbox port fowarding info as metadata, as this default port forwarding is NOT setup in VMWare or any other virtualization solution.

and like Dustin says if you use the GUI for the vm you don't need the ssh port.

Yes sorry we won't be releasing the project docs, and therefore the username and password, until the project opening date. The username and password will be on Canvas.

Each project has a different user account, and different password/username that will release with each project.

This early VM release is just to make sure you can get the VM up and running and troubleshoot any display or other issues, get bidirectional clipboard turned on, etc.

You can use VMWare, may students do. However, only virtualbox is supported (fully tested)

Just to clarify, there is a class VM that we will have to install later on for assignments.  A lot of talk on here about installing a VM now.  Are we going to need a Linux VM installed other than the class VM?  I also have VMWare fusion on a macbook pro intel. I am happy to install a Linux VM if we are supposed to do have one already installed. 

Thanks you,

VMWare is better than VirtualBox, pretty much hands down.

The only reason we recommend VirtualBox is that it's free, with Broadcom,VMWare, we're never sure where they're going with their pricing.

For now, Fusion and Workstation by VMWare are free for personal/edu use.

And I'll say esp. for people with Macs, VMWare is a better product.

It's just that we don't officially support it, but I personally recommend it.

To be clear, you're not saying if it's a M/ARM based Mac, in which case you should read #11.

If it's an Intel based Mac and it's new enough, per our specs on the course website, it will work fine with just VirtualBox (or VMWare), I don't see the need for Parallels but if you can make it work, great.

The VM can be run however you want, with the caveat that VirtualBox is the only supported platform, and extensions will not be granted for issues.

Using QEMU/UTM on ARM-based Macs + Course VM Download Thread #11

Only Use This Thread for ARM/QEMU/UTM and ssh-related questions. ALL OTHER VM Troubleshooting Questions go on the VM Troubleshooting Thread 

The VM Troubleshooting Thread is #10 

---

We will be releasing the course VM a bit early before the first project where you can use a VM.

This post will be updated and emailed to you when we update it, so be sure to be checking your email often, you already should check your email daily when at GA Tech.

This early release is to ensure that everyone has a chance to download it and test that they can boot the VM prior to the release of the first VM based project.

Note that for Spring 25, the first project, Man in the Middle, does not require a VM. The second project also does not require a VM, but can be done on the class VM. So you can roughly expect we'll release the VM ahead of the Machine Learning project.

VM Download link: Will be posted on Canvas on the Machine Learning project when we release it.

The VM requires VirtualBox 7.1.14 or higher and we always recommend that you use the latest version. 

You are welcome to attempt to use VMWare products, Parallels, or any other hypervisor of your choice but we cannot provide help in troubleshooting for anything other than VirtualBox.

EMULATION ON ARM-BASED MACS DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK WELL, IT'S SLOW

It's also possible to emulate the VM on ARM based Macs.  Our TA Eric Johnson decided to provide some details below on how he configures the emulation, but again these instructions come without any warranty - we cannot grant extensions due to emulation issues.

OVA Info:

Name: 

Size: 

SHA256: 

Note: None of the material below is necessary for running in VirtualBox on an Intel-based machine, but you can run the VM headless using the same SSH instructions as below:


Emulating x86/x64 on Apple MX Chipset

While it is possible to use emulation to run the CS6035 VMs it is important to note that it is not officially supported.

You will need to be familiar with SSH and using the terminal as the Linux GUI is not very responsive and you it will be impossible to finish the project using the VM GUI.

Disclaimers

The TAs will NOT assist you with any difficulties that arise from using an unsupported chipset.

You will NOT receive extensions due to technical difficulties with the VM.

Using emulation to complete the homework for the class is done at your own risk.

Requirements

1. A copy of the class VM in .ova format

2. A Linux system (you can use an ARM VM) or install QEMU on your 

Mac using [Homebrew](https://www.qemu.org/download/#macos)

3. [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app) or other any other emulation tool

4. At least 50GiB of drive space available

Obtaining the Virtual Disk Image from the OVA

For the purposes of this tutorial we will use the CS6035-Fall-2024-RC2.ova as the VM filename, be sure to adjust the instructions for your VM image.

Note that these instructions were created using a Linux VM and the exact commands may vary slightly on MacOS.

1. Open a terminal

2. Download the class VM

TBA


3. Extract the VM disk image from the OVA archive (look for the .vmdk file)

tar -xvf CS6035-Fall-2024-RC2.ova


4. Convert the disk image to qcow2 format

qemu-img convert -O qcow2 CS6035-Fall-2024-RC2-disk001.vmdk CS6035-Fall-2024-RC2.qcow2


Creating the Emulated Virtual Machine

Note these instructions assume that you are using UTM. The instructions will differ if you are not using UTM.

1. Open the UTM application

2. Click on the 'Create a new Virtual Machine' button

3. Click on the 'Emulate' button

4. Click on the 'Other' button

5. For 'Boot Device' select 'None'

6. Click on the 'Continue' button

6. For 'Architecture' ensure that 'x86_64' is selected

7. For 'System' you can use the default value of 'Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009) (alias of pc-q35-7.2)(q35)

8. Set the 'Memory' to ~50% of your total Mac RAM (We recommend 8192MB or more)

9. For Storage you can use the default of '64 GB' - we will be deleting this drive

10. You do not need to set a shared directory - click 'Continue'

11. Set the VM name (CS6035-Fall-2024-rc2 for example)

12. Click the 'Open VM Settings' checkbox

13. Click the 'Save' button

Configuring the Emulated Virtual Machine

The VM settings window should have opened once you saved the VM. Now you'll need to configure the VM to use your .qcow2 

image to boot the course VM.

1. Select the 'QEMU' menu item on the left

2. Disable (unselect) the 'UEFI Boot' option

3. Select the 'Display' menu item on the left

4. Set the 'Emulated Display Card' to 'virtio-gpu-gl-pci (GPU Supported)'

5. Select the 'IDE Drive' from the left hand menu

6. Click the 'Delete' button

7. A prompt will appear asking you to confirm the action - click the 'Delete' button

8. Select 'New...' under the 'Drives' section in the lefthand menu

9. A prompt will open - click the 'Import...' button

10. Find your drive image, 'CS6035-Fall-2024-RC2.qcow2' for this example

11. Click the 'Save' button in the bottom right of the Settings view

Completing Course Projects via SSH

Given the fact that emulating the Linux UI typically results in a poor user experience, the expectation is that you would use SSH to complete all project activities. If you are unable to use SSH to perform a specific task then you're unlikely to be able to complete the project using an emulated VM

Obtaining the VM's IP address

1. Power on the VM

2. Login to the VM as any user

3. Wait patiently while the UI loads. You may see a black screen

for a long period of time.

4. Open the 'terminal' application

5. Query all network interfaces: `ip a`

6. Find the entry for the VM's network interface card:

 Note that it is likely the second interface, denoted by `2:`

The default subnet for UTM is typically `192.168.64.0/24`

In this example: We will assume that the IP address for the course VM is 192.168.64.12 for the purposes of this example. Your IP address may vary. Please use the address identified above to complete each SSH command.

Completing the APISec project

Ensure that you have Chrome installed on your Mac.

Connect to the VM via ssh:

ssh -L 127.0.0.1:8080:127.0.0.1:8080 apisec@192.168.64.12


Use Chrome to connect to the project website:

http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html


Complete the project as described in the project documentation.

Completing the BinExp project

Connect to the VM via ssh:

ssh binexp@192.168.64.12


Complete the project as described in the project documentation.

NOTE: You will need to use tmux to properly use the debugger with your PwnTools scripts (e.py files) when connected via ssh.

Completing the DBSec project

Ensure that you have Chrome installed on your Mac.

Connect to the VM via ssh:

sudo ssh -L 127.0.0.1:80:127.0.0.1:80 -L 127.0.0.1:1433:127.0.0.1:1433 dbsec@192.168.64.12

Note: We must use sudo to connect to the VM as the DBSec uses port :80 for HTTP and MacOS will not allow a normal user account to forward to that port.

Navigate to the DBSec project website:

http://localhost/intro.html


Note: The DBSec project uses hostnames to present the various sites. That means you will need to add those hosts file on your Mac in order for the project pages to work.

Hi team,

I am a Macbook Pro M3 user. Though I follow the steps in this page, I feel that my vm is still very slow. Is there any good alternative for Mac ARM students? Thank you!

Unfortunately the performance on a Mac using the process above can be less than ideal for some of the projects. There isn't a lot of performance tweaking you can do. If you find it unusable you would need to look into other options such as running the VM in the cloud, which is not supported nor steps provided (can be timely to setup and costly to run), or use an intel/amd machine to run the VM in Virtualbox or VMWare

I am trying to use host to access the swagger instance, but when I run ssh -p 22 -L 5001:127.0.0.1:5001 apisec@localhost, I get ssh: connect to host localhost port 22: Connection refused. The ssh port should be fine since running with the apisec@VMIP works. Any suggested method to resolve would be m much appreciate, otherwise I am running a very laggy VM UI over UTM

Hello, when I try to ssh into my vm for binexp, i get a time out. I've looked up my vm ip and I am using the correct ip for my virtual machine. When checking the ssh service within vm, it says it's disabled, but I don't have sudo privileges to enable it.


Could you please advise on how to resolve this situation?

I didn't even know you could run systemctl as a normal user LOL I guess I wouldn't trust the results. The ssh server should be running.
Glad you got it going.

I hit a timeout while trying to ssh into the VM: 

$ ssh binexp@192.168.64.12
ssh: connect to host 192.168.64.12 port 22: Operation timed out
Does anyone know how this issue can be resolved.

Did you get the VM Ip by following the steps above under Obtaining the VM's IP address?
If not 192.168.64.12 isn't necessarily your VMs IP Address, just one used as an example: In this example: We will assume that the IP address for the course VM is 192.168.64.12 for the purposes of this example. Your IP address may vary. Please use the address identified above to complete each SSH command.

I followed all the steps up to 'Obtaining the VM's IP address,' but the screen remains white/grey even after waiting for a long time. I'm using an M1 MacBook. Is there anything I might have missed?

Unfortunately, this method is not a supported means of running the VM, and is provided for you to try, but not guaranteed it would work. There isn't much other than cleaning up everything and starting the process again. However, it is possible due to various configurations of your individual PC it will not be a viable solution

This is inside the VM? If so, the ML project can be run outside the VM and that would be my recommendation. If this is outside the VM, this should be posted in the appropriate ED thread: https://edstem.org/us/courses/69023/discussion/5989595 (after you search that thread to see if there isn't a similar post/entry)

Thank you for the great writeup with precise instructions. I was able to run the VM on ARM based Mac and this a a great relief. I dont have to carry two machines anymore. However, having issues with DNS resolution and not able to modify /etc/hosts either to have some hardcoding done either.

hmm ... perhaps you could try adding some common nameservers like the cloudflare one? I'm surprised as I'd expect the VM to mostly use the host networking stack

Thanks Ronnie, I will try few options. Resolve.conf is owned by root and sudo did not work either for me. Probably I will play around with symlink that seems to have 777 access. Will let you know how it goes.

Tried testing this out on my machine, but got stuck on step 2 of Obtaining the VM's IP address.  Firstly, the long wait for the UI to load happened before the log in screen (though it still may take a while after). Secondly for step 2 "Log in as any User": are there specifications for this user? I tried logging in with my GA Tech creds just to be sure, but no case was I able to log in. I keep getting "Sorry, password authentication didn't work. Please try again". Are there creds that are released when the VM is? Thanks!

Never mind: found the answer here--https://github.gatech.edu/pages/cs6035-tools/cs6035-tools.github.io/RequiredReading/VMTrouble.html 

The usernames and passwords are released on project release, though I am still wondering if there's one we can test with. In any case, I can wait until the current VM is released and everyone else is getting set up as well.

Where did you get a copy of our VM? 

Assuming you didn't, I don't know which VM you are talking about here.

Did you download some ISO or other OVA file? Ubuntu? something else?

We wouldn't know the credentials for someone else's vm, and we're not giving out the credentials for ours until the ML project opens, and then only for the ML account.

We will release the usernames/passwords with each project.

Sorry, we won't release credentials for that VM, I apologize that it was listed here.

And I'm really surprised it was still there for download.

Thanks and again, sorry for leaving that up.

Note that for Spring 25, the first project, Man in the Middle, does not require a VM. The second project also does not require a VM, but can be done on the class VM. So you can roughly expect we'll release the VM ahead of the Machine Learning project.
Since the VM won't be required until project 3, can the first two projects be completed on a mac M series processor without issue? My understanding was that the only expected difficult with using Apple silicon processors was the course VM, but I just wanted to confirm that. (I'm going to be out of the country for projects 1 and 2 and need to know whether I need to bring an x86 machine with me.)

Neither of the first two projects requires a VM.

The ML project has some initial setup that some people have trouble with, installing conda.

So some people will use the pre-setup environment on the VM for Machine Learning.

But you are encouraged to do it on your own host machine, not in the vm, for performance reasons.

Welcome to Week 7 of CS 6035 Introduction to Information Security!

Table of Contents 

Introductory Comments 

We'll make this weekly post throughout the semester, usually by Monday mid-day each week, summarizing what's coming up this week and putting a spotlight on a news item for further discussion.

We are usually quite responsive in this class forum! At the same time, by policy, students should expect to receive responses within 24 hours. If you have a private question, please make a private post here on Ed, per #9.

INTRO COMMENTS

Web Sec is open, the browser's Inspector tool is an invaluable resource. Make sure you understand what you're looking at there. Here's the docs for Mozilla/Firefox's tools and the docs for Chrome. 

Aside from that, I don't have a lot more to say about it so I'll repeat what I said last week:

When you're doing Web Sec and you see W3Schools' Javascript section come up in the search, that should be high on your list of things to click on. Also quite relevant, and often overlooked, is the actual Javascript/HMTL/CSS docs on the Mozilla Developer network (MDN). MDN is also great for understanding the Document Object Model (DOM) characteristics and Javascript Events.
You only get a week for Web Security -- I strongly recommend you start on Day 1, if you're not familiar with the concepts in the previous paragraph.
Today is Day 2, so get going!

RESEARCH IN EDUCATION

This week we're going to make a departure from grad-level research into K-12. 

I forget if I have introduced Dr. Nick Lytle, the Director of Research for OMS-CS. He's a great guy, there are bi-weekly "open coffee hours" that he holds if you ever have questions for him.

I was looking at his papers and this one was interesting to me:

PRADA: A Practical Model for Integrating Computational Thinking in K-12 Education

I got to the actual paper without any authentication. PRADA turns out to be an acronym for "Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, Decomposition, and Algorithms." No wonder they used an acronym! To those uninitiated in math and computer science, that's just a tangle of words.

Having said that, in fact, "Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, Decomposition, and Algorithms" is what we do all day long in computer science and cybersecurity, at least on the technical side of cybersecurity. We see some phenomenon, we come up with an abstraction (model) to help us understand it better. For many things, a complete understanding of the thing is not needed to use the thing, so abstraction helps us keep focused on the part of the thing that matters at the moment.

An example of this is the automobile. For most people, they have a detailed understanding of their cabin controls (music, windows, seats, navigation, etc) but they lack any fundamental understanding of how their cars actually work. 

As a person with extensive automobile mechanical experience (granted it was in my youth), I can more safely push a car to its limits because I have an understanding of the mechanical aspects of the car. I actually know in my head what my steering linkage looks like, for example. But this deep knowledge only helps at the margins. (the margins can be critical, like knowing instinctively what to do if the car goes into a slide). 

For everyday driving, things can be simplified. The same is true for computer science. Instead of needing to know the details of computer architecture, programming and systems administration, educators can be taught some basics about computer science and then pass those lessons along to their students. This paper continues the argument in favor of infusing "Computational Thinking" into the teaching practices of educators across the spectrum.

The paper presents a system where non-computer science oriented K-12 educators are introduced to "Computational Thinking" (CT) so they in turn can integrate CT into their courses:

We piloted PRADA as part of a summer PD (professional development) on infusing CT into middle and high school content area courses. Dur- ing the PD, we taught and encouraged teachers to both recognize the PRADA elements that already exist in their courses, and also helped them to create digital artifacts in a block-based program- ming language to facilitate teaching PRADA.
Just like in the car driving analogy, where everyone can operate a car without a detailed understanding of its mechanical aspects, in CT teachers can be trains to impart CT to their students without needing a full computer science background.

It turns out that PRADA comes from Google's "Computational Thinking for Educators" course. The modified definition of the terms is as follows:

Pattern Recognition -- observing and identifying patterns, trends,
and regularities in data, processes, or problems
Abstraction -- identifying the general principles and properties that
are important and relevant to the problem
Decomposition -- breaking down data, processes, or problems into
meaningful smaller, manageable parts
Algorithms -- developing step by step instructions for solving [a
problem] and similar problems

To me, the most relevant aspect of this here in CS 6035 is decomposition. You need to be able to take big problems and break them down into smaller problems, then solve the small problems and put the results together.

It's an interesting paper for a quick scan, to me the most interesting part is the Case Studies where they detail what the teacher teams came up with to present to their students:

One team made a puzzle-based history game. Once abstraction here is the timeline. Introducing the concept of a timeline early in students' education has parallels with time series analysis.

Another team "created a historical role-playing game to provide context for
students’ reading of narrative and expository texts."

A science-oriented team did a "Rock and Mineral Quiz" where the teachers used Snap! to build a quiz system and a lab monitoring system.

The math-oriented team did a football-themed game where students have to answer questions and each question is associated with a number of yards in a theoretical football game.

It actually doesn't sound like they developed any earthshaking apps, but the educators walked away with an understanding of computer science. But they were exposed to programming concepts through the use of the Snap! language. Snap! is like Scratch, which I have some exposure to. Basic programming elements are broken down into blocks, and the student drags and drops block into a "program" to make a series of statements that will execute. Here's a sample:


If you've never heard of Snap! or Scratch, they are a great way to introduce kids of any age to computer programming. One interesting application is to use Scratch to control a Tello drone. I don't know who hosts this site, but it talks about using Scratch with the Tello drone. A Tello is an educational drone, if you're interested, look up a Tello EDU or a Tello Robomaster TT. Note this is a Alibaba link, apparently these drones are no longer on Amazon.

SECURITY IN THE NEWS

Sorry for no news last week. I'll do something this week, and will post here when it's ready. Thanks for your patience, I'm just really busy with a project from my day job.

Funnily enough, I had a class in high school that used "Snap!" to learn programming concepts. While it's not the greatest tool for real development, it still allows for development of subroutines/functions, abstraction, recursion, loops, etc. For making 2D visual apps, it's certainly a lot easier than learning QT/pygame/openGL haha
