Are we using the same curl command as Flag 4? I used it to test, and it still connected to my LDAP successfully. I already know the other topics name and such based off hints given below.

Got the flag. I strongly recommend taking a look at the logs upon restart of app or at the setup page if you feel you are missing something.

I am not seeing the pattern everyone keeps referencing, or where the acc number originates.  I have restarted the container and skimmed through the start up logs, I see the initial messages for the topics, but I guess I am not sure what to do with them.  I have tried using the other topics parameters to send a curl and all i get is errors, and looking through the error logs I don't really see anything helpful.  

Any direction anyone can provide?  I am kind of lost as to how to proceed here

I would experiment with the parameters of the request using some unique strings. Then, review the logs to see if you can identify a method to manipulate the account number field.

Some may disagree, but I wasn't a big fan of the word pattern. Kind of confused me. I ending up took it as looking for similarities since I was not seeing a pattern

I'm so close to actually getting this flag and scoring 3 flags in a a single day. Just struggling with getting the value of the account number to be my GATECH_ID. Any suggestions with this everyone? I'm seeing in this thread that there's a pattern but I'm not sure what that is referring too.. 

EDIT: NEVERMIND!! I SAW THE PATTERN THAT EVERYONE WAS REFERRING TO! I'M ON FIRE AFTER SO LONG!

Is the new topic already in the properties file or do we create a new one? Just a bit confused on that part. I keep getting NullPointerException when publishing, any suggestions/hints?

You do not need to create a new topic. I'd suggest scanning the logs from the beginning after you restart the app.

Found the new topic, have my attack vector, and figured out how to change the publishing user ID.  What I can't figure out is how to change the publishing topic.  I am using similar code from flag 4, but for some reason the topic is staying as user.info.  Is there a method to figure out what the topic parameter is named in the config.properties file?  I feel like I am missing something extremely simple, like I am not calling the topic name parameter properly in my java script to edit which topic is published.


Is my thought process in the right place, or should I try heading in a different direction?

I think you are heading in the right direction. Sometimes, I forget to use javac . When you make a change to a file, see for yourself by reading the file if the change persisted.

I put some prints in each of my Java to spot check if my scripts got run and when I run CURL for flag5, I surprised to find that my script for Flag4 was actually running according to my print. I have double checked my directory but still the same. What I am missing for set up?

Figured out here! Be sure to update the directory for your Malicious Server.

2. Run the Malicious Server:
Open a new terminal and make sure the active directory is the directory that contains your malicious .class file. For simplicity, we have created “Desktop/log4shell/{flag_no}” for you to work in. Do not leave this directory. Run the server in “Desktop/log4shell/{flag_no}” by the following command:

Just got it. Just to recap some of what the below comments will point you toward:

It is very helpful to tail the console.log file and then restart the container to get those fresh logs.

You'll probably be well served to re-use some of your logic from Flag 4's Exploit.java file concerning config.properties

 Look at the curl that the instructions give you, and look at the logs. See if there is a value being passed that you could change from within the curl you're given.

I tired to inject my jndi into variable to fire my Exploit. It result in Status 500 Internal Server Error.  But in the log I did see the Topic read from properties file changed to my GT_ID. and also publishing to topic: is also my GT_ID. I'm not getting the flag is because of the error. 

I'm not sure how to update that accountNum.  I tried different CURL commands, try to find  the pattern or a way to trigger that other topic, but it just keep giving me 500 errors. :(

You need to set the topic name to the other topic. Your gatech id needs to be in the account number field.

My suggestion is to try publishing to the topic just to see what logs will be generated and analyze it carefully. You will be able to find what you need to figure out the trick to publish. Compare it against the hint the staff provided to look at the fresh logs carefully

Based on the writeup, you are to identify another topic to publish the message to, I suggest you to first try publishing to that identified topic with the provided curl convention just to see what logs will be generated and analyze it carefully. You will be able to find what you need to figure out the trick to publish. Compare it against the hint the staff provided to look at the fresh logs carefully. There will be a pattern where you will start to see once you compare the logs. Read the logs carefully and analyze them, it will be worth it.

You can do this! Will take note of this post as well if you require more clarifications.

Can't seem to get past the 500 errors. I thought I saw a subtle difference but it gets thrown away in the PUT. Logs just seem to be pulling out what is required for the first topic and erroring out because it isn't finding everything for it.

I was able to change the topic, but I still can't update the message being sent. 

I researched where the account number originates from and the pattern involved, and I'm still unsure if I should be using Exploit.java or Curl. I even looked at the github flag5 picture for hints. Any advice would be appreciated because I think I'm overcomplicating this.

I have found the right different topic. But I am not sure where to update the accountNum value to be my GT_ID.  I know we will need to update the “config.properties” file in Exploit.java. Should I update  accountNum on the Exploit.java file or using the Curl command?

This is a dumb question. But by restarting the app, do you mean sending the endpoint to the server again and checking it's resulting logs? Or are we restarting the container?

Not a dumb question! You by restarting the app it means ./Stop and ./Start container. When applications start they sometimes log checkpoints  and configurations ;)
