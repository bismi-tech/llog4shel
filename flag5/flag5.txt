I seem to have tapped into the accountNumber but I see this in the logs

Unable to get flag. Please ensure you entered your GatechId as the accountNumber in the messageVO body as instructed in the writeup

However, when debugging i see my gatechid was part of a received message, what else could this error mean?

I got my topic to change to the correct topic and my accountNum is set to my georgia tech ID but the flag is still not printing and says the unable to get flag please ensure your GatechId as the account number error message but accountnumber is showing my GATECH Id so I am not sure where to go from here?

I got a flag, but I didn't see any print statements indicating that the program was entering my exploit

I haven't seen any print statements I tried to use. I have double checked that my GTID is correct on everything though

This flag was surprisingly  easy to solve. It really is just like flag 3 imo.
Advice for anyone who may be stuck later: follow the discussion in this thread it helps a lot. 
And, if you mess up like me, the logs just tell you where to put what (assuming you did something like one of the previous flags first) 😄

Interesting hint. If you use the methods used in Flag 2 to attain a reverse shell, looking at the input of the config.properties file helped me get the flag. I knew what the "other" topic name was already and had the correct Exploit.java written already, but wasn't overwriting the config.properties file correctly because I didn't have the variable name correct. I realized what it was actually called by inspecting the config.properties file.

I'm not sure what everyone means by "pattern", but I found the other topic in the logs and where it originates from. I tried setting it in my java code but it doesn't seem to do anything or reappear later in the logs when I check the logs after running my curl command. I know I am able to inject bc I see feedback from LDAP and the python server after I run my curl command. Am I on the right track, is there more to the "pattern" than the statement I see where the topic originates in the logs?

You also need to set your GATECH_ID as the account number in order to generate a valid flag. Review the logs to see if you can identify a method or "pattern" to manipulate the account number field.

The java code only needs to overwrite the config.properties file with the new topic name. You'd need to review the logs and find out how the account number field is getting populated.

Am I correct in assuming that in this flag we are Not simply updating the config file, we are overwriting it? The instructions for this one say we need to overwrite yet the instructions for flag 3 specified we had to make sure we just update.

We are exploiting the same endpoint from flag 4 but the curl command might not be exactly the same (since there are a bunch of different things that you need to do in order to get the flag).

I am not seeing the pattern everyone keeps referencing, or where the acc number originates.  I have restarted the container and skimmed through the start up logs, I see the initial messages for the topics, but I guess I am not sure what to do with them.  I have tried using the other topics parameters to send a curl and all i get is errors, and looking through the error logs I don't really see anything helpful.  

Any direction anyone can provide?  I am kind of lost as to how to proceed here

Found the new topic, have my attack vector, and figured out how to change the publishing user ID.  What I can't figure out is how to change the publishing topic.  I am using similar code from flag 4, but for some reason the topic is staying as user.info.  Is there a method to figure out what the topic parameter is named in the config.properties file?  I feel like I am missing something extremely simple, like I am not calling the topic name parameter properly in my java script to edit which topic is published.


Is my thought process in the right place, or should I try heading in a different direction?

I think you are heading in the right direction. Sometimes, I forget to use javac . When you make a change to a file, see for yourself by reading the file if the change persisted.

Figured out here! Be sure to update the directory for your Malicious Server.

2. Run the Malicious Server:
Open a new terminal and make sure the active directory is the directory that contains your malicious .class file. For simplicity, we have created “Desktop/log4shell/{flag_no}” for you to work in. Do not leave this directory. Run the server in “Desktop/log4shell/{flag_no}” by the following command:

Just got it. Just to recap some of what the below comments will point you toward:

It is very helpful to tail the console.log file and then restart the container to get those fresh logs.

You'll probably be well served to re-use some of your logic from Flag 4's Exploit.java file concerning config.properties

 Look at the curl that the instructions give you, and look at the logs. See if there is a value being passed that you could change from within the curl you're given.

I tired to inject my jndi into variable to fire my Exploit. It result in Status 500 Internal Server Error.  But in the log I did see the Topic read from properties file changed to my GT_ID. and also publishing to topic: is also my GT_ID. I'm not getting the flag is because of the error. 

I'm not sure how to update that accountNum.  I tried different CURL commands, try to find  the pattern or a way to trigger that other topic, but it just keep giving me 500 errors. :(

Based on the writeup, you are to identify another topic to publish the message to, I suggest you to first try publishing to that identified topic with the provided curl convention just to see what logs will be generated and analyze it carefully. You will be able to find what you need to figure out the trick to publish. Compare it against the hint the staff provided to look at the fresh logs carefully. There will be a pattern where you will start to see once you compare the logs. Read the logs carefully and analyze them, it will be worth it.

You can do this! Will take note of this post as well if you require more clarifications.

Can't seem to get past the 500 errors. I thought I saw a subtle difference but it gets thrown away in the PUT. Logs just seem to be pulling out what is required for the first topic and erroring out because it isn't finding everything for it.
