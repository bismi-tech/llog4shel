This is so hard, I cannot find the right different topic.

I suggest restarting the app to get fresh logs and going from there. Having a lot of noise in this project can make it harder to look.

I already restart and extract the logs from original instruction but no idea where could valid topics be. I search through cs6035.log and console.log but nothing interesting comes up. Could you provide me more hint please?

This builds off of flag 4. Pay attention to where the account number comes from.

I'm getting stuck with the (cleaned up) message:

Unable to get flag. Please ensure you entered your GatechId as the accountNumber in the messageVO body as instructed in the write up.
But I can see

INFO   Received message {[SELF REDACTED],"accountNum":"<my GTID>"} for topic: <target topic>
What am I missing?

\*facepalm\* I was passing the copy/pasted "" value for my GTID header. Updated it to my GTID and got the flag.

So I've been trying to look for the other topic that is supposed to be on the cs6035.log file but I am not sure if this is the way to go. Should I look for an already created topic or should I create a topic?

thanks

Correct, the other topic's name is in the logs. I recommend restarting the app and looking closely at the fresh logs.

If only I had read this comment two hours ago, it would have saved me a few hours.

I'd also say that if you don't see it right away, just try something and see what errors you get. I found the error logs to be pretty helpful!
