 These references feel a bit random but I'm here for it. I like the Ronnie Coleman reference lol.

I have got the db details , but still not able get the flag, have few questions on this:

1. Does the exploit need to be triggered by the delete endpoint providing by the instruction or any endpoint is fine ?

2. is userName MWAD10 necessary for header X-NetworkUserId or this can be replaced by EDBOY?

Take a look at #9 
These questions are a bit too specific. A student answering these will be violating academic honesty. I'll keep this up as an example though.

Try to generalize these questions.

I see that flag 7 is extra 2pts. Will the assignment grade calculated as 102/100 if flag 7 is captured?

Yes, you will get 102/100

I am getting 500 when I call the delete as per the instructions. I have the exploit code that is inserting the record in the DB using Flag2 and also handling the duplicate record situation. 

But no matter how I call the DELETE API I am getting internal errors. 


Looking into the log it is throwing a Java Null exception from the initial code of the REST API. Can you please help to see what is wrong with my approach?

Am I supposed to call the delete API with id, userName, user_id; is any of these need to go into the head or body of the request instead of the URL as per the instructions? 

I also noticed that my inserted record does not show as part of the return from the all users API, not sure if that is expected or indicates something wrong.

Hi Anuj!

This is unimplemented (Not needed to get the flag) and figured it could effect the flag if we allowed you to delete all users. Nothing is wrong with your approach. I will make note to add better documentation around this :) 

As for the inserted record, we reset the database each time the service is called to help safeguard around people inserting into the database another way and just calling the flag.

I suspect that I'm going down the wrong path so I'm going to ask three questions to see.

Do I have to use the database credentials?

Is there a good way to obfuscate the one value being checked for since my normal methods aren't working?

Is the jndi approach from previous flags necessary?

1. Yes

2. Not sure what you mean here, I did not need to obfuscate for this flag ;)

3. Yes, you will need to leverage that for sure.

Okay then. I'm clearly headed down the very wrong path. Thanks for confirming.

Ahhhh! When people said that this was a deceptively simple flag, they weren't kidding. It makes perfect sense in hindsight, but I spent hours working on it. This comment made a big difference.

Also, keep in mind that each flag tells you all relevant endpoints. When the instructions say "The endpoint for this exploit can be called" and only list one endpoint as a curl command, they truly mean that this is the only endpoint you need. Don't get caught up on any other endpoints/options you may discover like I did.

For some reason when my payload is triggered it inserts two users into the database before auth. I did check my code to make sure it is only inserting one, and I don't think my payload is being triggered more than once. Has anyone else experienced this? Any tips?

It's likely being triggered more than once, mine was. Had to rethink my payload a bit. One thing that helped me a lot on this project in general is the concept of idempotency:

I got my flag right before I saw this. I definitely had to rethink my payload. I wrote some logic to prevent the insert from happening twice. It very well could have been triggered twice, although I only saw my payload once in the logs.

I have added the logic to prevent duplicate records, but my Rest call to DELETE is always returning with Internal error 500, and when i check the log I see JavaNull pointer exceptions. Is there a particular way to execute the DELETE call? I have tried it with id, userName, and userID as part of the URL, but no luck.

I had the same issue. A step to prevent the same data from being entered twice was helpful.

Is there a name of the db that we need to connect to? Any hints if anyone tried it or TAs? Thanks!

I got the db uri username password using the technic from one of the flag before.

Any more hints guys, seems like the flag makes sure to delete my injections before auth?

Just like other flags, we have to find a way to perform our exploit after the protections and checks are run.

This tip helped me, I was getting thrown off by Internal Error 500, which is part of the feature for this flag. Thank you.

It might be helpful to think about how your Java web application gets its DB connection information to connect to the DB.
