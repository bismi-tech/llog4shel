If I use a certain statement that shows environment variables on the host, it doesn't show that Admin Password environment variable exists. It does show other variables and I can get those using curl. Admin Password shows "" empty string.

That is because this env variable exists in the container the app is running on, not the host.

Running curl though shows "" empty string as noted above, which should be hitting the container the app is running on, since that is a copy paste and add the header. Any suggestions?

Hello, I got below errors when run ./StartContainer.sh and i didn't see any log file under folder /home/log4j/Desktop/log4shell/logs 

Any ideas/suggestions on this error ?

Error:

Hmm, I am not 100% sure. But my guess is maybe you have another project running in the VM? If not, I would restart the vm or maybe worst case redownload it and re-import :/

I thought this would be low hanging fruit but here I am. I can retrieve other variables but not ADMIN_PASSWORD.  Hmm....

Try modifying your payload to target this specific variable.

That's what I've done or at least I think. I can call some other individual variables successfully while others don't seem to exist (null value) or are blocked (bad request). Calling ADMIN_PASSWORD in different ways brings back a null value each time which tells me it doesn't exist.

Is restarting the container the surest way the environment is "reset?"

Yes, restarting the container should reset your environment.

I tried many different syntaxes to make it work. If you're experiencing the same issue, I recommend checking out the Background article for this project.
