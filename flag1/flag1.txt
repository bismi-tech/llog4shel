Hello, I got below errors when run ./StartContainer.sh and i didn't see any log file under folder /home/log4j/Desktop/log4shell/logs 

Any ideas/suggestions on this error ?

Error:

docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint xenodochial_merkle (4a49486c583a51d5fc92dc9cffb0f290a1fc8fafc66a4130b0d12070e3a3bee5): failed to bind port 0.0.0.0:8080/tcp: Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:8080: bind: address already in use.

Hmm, I am not 100% sure. But my guess is maybe you have another project running in the VM? If not, I would restart the vm or maybe worst case redownload it and re-import :/

I thought this would be low hanging fruit but here I am. I can retrieve other variables but not ADMIN_PASSWORD.  Hmm....

Try modifying your payload to target this specific variable.

That's what I've done or at least I think. I can call some other individual variables successfully while others don't seem to exist (null value) or are blocked (bad request). Calling ADMIN_PASSWORD in different ways brings back a null value each time which tells me it doesn't exist.

Is restarting the container the surest way the environment is "reset?"

Yes, restarting the container should reset your environment.

I tried many different syntaxes to make it work. If you're experiencing the same issue, I recommend checking out the Background article for this project.
