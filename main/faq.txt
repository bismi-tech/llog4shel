FAQ 

Please ask any questions you have in this thread. 

Start by watching the project introduction:

Project Introduction (Might not match the project requirements exactly)



Extra Resources (these are also linked in the instructions):

This simple LDAP server that will be used to run the exploit.

This Log4JExploit Intro and How Log4Shell Works to familiarize yourself with the exploit and how it is accomplished.

If you have no experience in Java, Log4j/logging, RESTful applications, JNDI, LDAP, we STRONGLY encourage you to do research into the topics. There are many great resources online like Google and YouTube.

Log4J Documentation

Hands on Intro (THIS IS NOT A TUTORIAL, do not copy commands verbatim here. This is simple an external resource that explains the general concepts and steps of the exploit well)

Helpful Linux Networking Commands

NCAT Command

If you would like to learn more about this exploit and Java Object Deserialization Vulnerabilities this paper written by Moritz Bechler is an excellent research paper: Java Unmarshaller Security and so is this BlackHat presentation: A JOURNEY FROM JNDI/LDAP MANIPULATION TO REMOTE CODE EXECUTION DREAM LAND
