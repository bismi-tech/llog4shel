Log4Shell Project Explained Simply
Hi there! I'll explain this Log4Shell project in a simple way that's easy to understand.
What is This Project About?
Imagine you have a diary where you write down everything that happens during your day. Log4j is like a diary for computer programs - it keeps track of what the program is doing.
But there's a problem with this diary. If someone writes a special message in it, instead of just writing it down, the diary might actually try to do what the message says! This is called the "Log4Shell vulnerability."
What You'll Be Doing
In this project, you'll be like a detective, finding ways to make the diary do different things:

First, you'll make it tell you a secret password
Then, you'll make it let you control the computer
You'll change settings files
You'll make it create new files
You'll trick it into sending messages to different places
You'll store tricky information that activates later
As an extra challenge, you can try to add a new user to the system

How to Set Things Up
You'll need to open different windows on the computer:

One window to start the vulnerable program
One window to watch what the program is doing
One window to run a special server that helps with the tricks
One window to run another server that sends the tricks
One window to type commands to the program

The Basic Trick
The basic trick works like this:

You send a message to the program
The program writes your message in its diary
If your message has a special code like ${jndi:ldap://...}, instead of just writing it down, the program will try to follow that address
When it follows the address, it runs your trick!

Getting Started
For the first flag, you just need to make the program tell you a password that's stored in its memory. You'll do this by sending a special message in the right place.
For the other flags, you'll need to create Java code files that do different things when the program runs them.
Important Things to Remember

This is a real security problem in the world, so you're only allowed to try this in the special computer they gave you
You'll need to follow the instructions exactly for each flag
When you find each "flag" (a special message that proves you did it right), you'll add it to a file
You can try as many times as you want before the deadline
