So as suggested below I was able to get the java version printed out so I know I have the attack vector. But when I try to put the actual exploit i have, I see a code 400 message bad on my python server with a string of hex chars. Is the file not supposed to be in the root? I do see a path being shown and I tried with that as well. Same issue.

Edit: I also still don't see my print statements in the console.log file either

If your python server is throwing 400 errors, then your exploit is not being triggered because the python server failed. I would check that you are running it in the directory your .class file is in and check that you compiled your java code.

I double checked and I am running the py server in the Flag4 directory. I also have recompiled the java file with no issues.

For this one, I found it really helpful to start by just seeing if I could find the java version. If you can get the java version, you're in the right direction. Note that you don't need to get the java version, it's just a very easy way to see if you found the attack vector.

I only see one reference to the following error :

[UserService.java:87] ERROR Ronnie.txt was created but contents != "AintNothinButAPeanut!". Contents were: null

down below on the threads and that seems to have been resolved by the poster somehow. Would I be getting this error because the the server seems to wanna write this 3 or so many times ? I just need to ensure that the code only writes if value not present as suggested in flag 3 ? or  would this be a matter of failure to write all together ?

Hmm, I don't think you need to ensure if the code only writes once or not, you just need to make sure that it only creates a file with the contents of "AintNothingButAPeanut!" in it. Make sure your code is actually writing to the file. Have you ran this locally?

Kevin, I did manage to get the flag. Issue was that I was not closing the file. Much like C java won't write/flush the buffer unless closed looks like. 
This is making me appreciate with statements in python so much more. 
Thanks for the help! ðŸ˜„

Hello, is the attack vector quite obvious in the logs ? 
I thought it was the Msg but looks like that's just the exception msg var.
I did confirm that if we try to do ldap without masking it'll trigger a teapot via the exploitation method in flag 2. I have a good idea of what I need to do to get the actual flag ... i'm just stuck on finding the vector that should be used past the connection reset portion. Any hints on this ? 
Thank you.

I'm now getting this error: Reference Class Name: foo

is this a good sign ?

Update this was indeed a good sign. Fun fact, don't try to add "Reference Class Name" as a key value pair. I did that thinking "Concatenation" and VM crashed ðŸ˜† 
Turns out my java Exploit wasn't compiled.

Nice work! The reference class foo is a response from the ldap in an event a request fails

I am a little bit uncertain on my current approach,  the attack vector I am using is something really straightforward ( really its given to us on the writeup). I am able to execute the reverse shell and see the LDAP connecting the python server connecting which i thought I'm on the right track but with the hints being "command and concat" im no longer sure I'm on the right track . 

should i keep working on how i am working towards rn or am i heading in the wrong direction.

thanks in advance.

is the supposed attack vector that you got on the curl command that was provided ?
Not sure if you can answer this without giving it away lol sadly

I don't think I can answer that , but i ended up getting the flag , Apparently I was on the right track think about what are you given and the current curl command how does that show up in the server logs , try placing in your values for the reverse hell and see what triggers it . Keep in mind the timing of your attack vector what shows up where to avoid resetting .

I am stuck on this one like the others. I have the exploit to the point where I can redirect to my JavaScript. The file is created but after the file is checked if it exists. I understand "use the name, command and concat" but I don't understand where to apply this.

What's the proper way to send logs from the Java file for debugging purposes?
I've been using  System.out.println but I never see logs with that, is it any log4j library that needs to be imported in order to send debugging logs propertly?

To see the System.out.println messages you need to tail the console.log file not the cs6035.log file. If you still don't see it, then it's likely that your exploit is not getting executed.

In that case we would have to keep a separated terminal for tracking console.log instead right? I was trying to see if I can send them to appear in the same cs6035.log file when the exploit was executed.

If you're still stuck, try putting in the curl that is given in the instructions and look at the exception that is logged.

You guys were NOT kidding as far as sandwiching your stuff. Honestly, I'm glad I took a good look at this thread for ideas.

EDIT: GOD, THE IMPLICATIONS THIS FLAG HAS IS CRAZY. I won't say what it is because that would give away how to solve this flag but like, oh my god. The possibilities are endless, provided you match the format given.

Do not overthink this one, look at the log and see what comes back once you submit the test/example call. Like the hint says "Pay close attention to the logged messages and their format."  What was occurring with the data sent, was the biggest clue for me. If you completed previous flags to get to this point then you know what the original format of the lookup should be.

Would you say, like the other flags, the best approach is to figure out the attack vector, successfully ping the LDAP, and THEN work on the Exploit.java script? The reason I ask is because I'm 95% sure I know the attack vector and given the hint regarding "Command and Concat" I cant figure out how to "sandwich" the jndi lookup in the output to call my ldap correctly.

Would seeing the i'm a teapot message mean I need to change my vector or encode/obfuscate it somehow? running into this on flag 3 too - can't escape it lol


Reply

No, the teapot error means that there is a homegrown filter in place that you need to bypass using encoding/obfuscation.

You can get this flag however WITHOUT obfuscation and the name of this flag is a hint as to how.

Are we supposed to find a way to bypass:  [Log4jUtilities.java:32] INFO Reset files? If I understand correctly this is being performed right before it looks for the .txt file, so I'm assuming any files being created will be deleted on that action?

Yes, you'd need to exploit at the right point to get the flag. I'd recommend going through the logs carefully to figure out the correct attack vector.

It's possible to execute code the way you did for 3 but it won't result in the flag in my experience.   If you look at the picture of the flag in the flag4 github you can see it was not gotten the same way as 3 or 2. Use the hint to figure out a new way keep an eye on any hints of what variables can be overwritten.

Been able to create a file and proved it happened by creating it in the logs... can't seem to add to it though...
Approaching similar to Flag1, and I have a way to make that file... but the usual way I'd "write/push" to it seems to not work?

got it to write to the other location, but not the base one... 
Is the vector different?

Without giving away too many hints, I don't actually quite get what this has to do with the flag's name. Is there a way to leverage the mechanism explicitly or is this the same as any other log4j injection into a variable...? Just curious, because it seems to work by just updating one vulnerable variable.

i just exploited the vulnerability in the "intended" way probably, by leveraging the name of the flag. But, it still seems to work without it... wondering if I am tripping

There could be something wrong with your java code. Can you confirm your code is executing? If so, are you printing out the catch block to check if an exception has been thrown?
