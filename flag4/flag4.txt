Without giving away too many hints, I don't actually quite get what this has to do with the flag's name. Is there a way to leverage the mechanism explicitly or is this the same as any other log4j injection into a variable...? Just curious, because it seems to work by just updating one vulnerable variable.

i just exploited the vulnerability in the "intended" way probably, by leveraging the name of the flag. But, it still seems to work without it... wondering if I am tripping

I'm creating the file but it gets reset, how am I supposed to pass in the exploit? Is there another variable?

The name of this flag is a huge hint as to what you need to do. Pay close attention to the logged messages and their format.
