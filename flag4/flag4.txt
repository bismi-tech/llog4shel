I managed to get the message that shows `Congratulations! Your flag4 is: ...`. But when i copy and submit that value to Gradescope, it shows up as incorrect. Could a TA please help me check if i indeed have the correct value?

Don't forget to compile Exploit.java after you edit your code. I just waste hours for this.

Been able to create a file and proved it happened by creating it in the logs... can't seem to add to it though...
Approaching similar to Flag1, and I have a way to make that file... but the usual way I'd "write/push" to it seems to not work?

got it to write to the other location, but not the base one... 
Is the vector different?

Figured it out

and it's a little funny being able to use it in that way. Will say that I thought I'd break the rest of it though...

Without giving away too many hints, I don't actually quite get what this has to do with the flag's name. Is there a way to leverage the mechanism explicitly or is this the same as any other log4j injection into a variable...? Just curious, because it seems to work by just updating one vulnerable variable.

i just exploited the vulnerability in the "intended" way probably, by leveraging the name of the flag. But, it still seems to work without it... wondering if I am tripping

I'm creating the file but it gets reset, how am I supposed to pass in the exploit? Is there another variable?

The name of this flag is a huge hint as to what you need to do. Pay close attention to the logged messages and their format.
