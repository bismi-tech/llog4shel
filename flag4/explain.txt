Alright! Let me explain Flag 4: Command and Concat in a super simple way, like you're a kid.

Imagine you have a magic notebook that listens to what you say and writes things down. But this notebook has a tiny problemâ€”if you whisper the right secret words, you can make it write something that you control! That means you can trick it into writing whatever you want.

For this challenge, your job is to trick the computer (like the magic notebook) into creating a file called "Ronnie.txt" and writing "AintNothinButAPeanut!" inside it. But the computer wonâ€™t just listen to youâ€”you need to speak its secret language.

Here's how you do it:

Find the secret way to tell the computer to write things down (this is the "attack vector").
Use a special trick (log4shell) to give it a command, like:
"Hey, magic notebook! Create a file and write â€˜AintNothinButAPeanut!â€™ in it!"

Make sure your message follows the rules exactly, or the computer won't do it.
ðŸ”Ž Hints:

The name of the challenge, "Command and Concat," is a big hint!
"Command" means you need to tell the computer what to do.
"Concat" (short for concatenation) means joining things together (maybe you need to combine words or pieces of text in a smart way!).
You need to create a Java program (Exploit.java) that the computer will "read" and then follow your instructions.
If something goes wrong, restarting the system might help!
So, in short: You are using a hidden trick to convince the computer to create a file and put your secret phrase in it. Once you do that, you win the challenge! ðŸŽ‰
