# Understanding the Log4Shell Project

Let me explain this like you're just learning about computer security for the first time!

## The Big Picture

This is a college assignment about a famous computer security problem called "Log4Shell." It's like a door that hackers found in many computer systems in 2021. This door lets bad guys sneak into computers they shouldn't have access to.

## What You Need to Do (Flag 2)

For this assignment, you need to:

1. Set up 4 different windows on your computer:
   - A window to run a special server called "LDAP" 
   - A window to run a simple web server with Python
   - A window where you'll listen for connections with a tool called "netcat"
   - A window to run your attack command

2. Create a special file called "Exploit.java" that will:
   - Create a connection back to your computer
   - Give you control of the target server

3. When everything works correctly:
   - You'll type a special command that triggers the vulnerability
   - Your code will run on the vulnerable server
   - The server will connect back to your computer
   - You'll get a "shell" (way to type commands) as the powerful "root" user
   - You can then run a special jar file to get your flag

## Why Students Are Struggling

From the discussion posts, students are having trouble with:
1. Getting the right IP addresses and port numbers
2. Making sure their Java code is correct
3. Understanding how all the pieces connect together

The recommended approach is to watch a video tutorial called "HackerSploit" that shows almost exactly what to do, and to use the Docker host IP address (172.17.0.1) rather than localhost.

Does any specific part of this challenge sound confusing, or would you like me to explain a particular step in more detail?
