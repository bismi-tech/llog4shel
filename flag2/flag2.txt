I'm having trouble figuring out where I'm going wrong on this one. I fully understand the exploit, and I believe I understand which servers need to communicate with which; however, I'm still not able to get the my curl command to interact with the LDAP server and all of that. I'm using a similar strategy to what I did in flag 1. 

The documentation states this in the setup section:
It is very important that this matches the port specified in the LDAP server. If your exploit is not working because it is not connecting to the malicious server, your ports likely do not match OR the vm’s IP is not correct

I'm curious about situations where the VM's IP being incorrect could affect this setup? I don't see any explicit references to the VM IP address, so I'm wondering if maybe I'm missing a step regarding that?

So, I followed along with the recommended Hackersploit video, and I'm running into an error with my curl syntax. It says, "400: GATECH_ID header not sent or invalid." I've tried inputting it in multiple different ways, and I'm still running into the issue. Is there any advice?

If it is saying log4j is the user not root, then you likely are connecting to the nc terminal directly from the host NOT from the exploit. I assume you are calling it directly from your curl. If so, that is not correct.

Not sure where I am going wrong, but I am following each of the steps in the hackersplot video as well as the walkthrough and I don't see the LDAP getting called correctly (no message like 'send LDAP reference result...' in the LDAP terminal). Where could I be going wrong? I have all the terminals set up as per the instructions with the right ports.

Rakshaa, I'm with there. Though, make sure you know which IP the marshalsec server has and note the port it is using. It SHOULD be reflected in your curl command when you attempt connection. I still can't connect to the target but hope this helps!

Figured I might as well ask right now and step back until tomorrow, but I am having trouble with this one part.

Similar to Xiauhou’s comment, I am at the segment where I am supposed to reverse-shell connect into the vulnerable system. I have a sneaking suspicion what I feel may be the right answer, but do EACH of the steps of the set up need to occur within the same flag folder or just the netcat command? I also made a silly mistake I think and I made my payload later on, which I will check tomorrow, but will that also impact my ability to connect?

Definitely will also check out the hackersploit video and log4j walkthrough again tomorrow before office hours.

I am not entirely sure what you mean by this, but what I think you are asking the answer is no. The only thing that needs to be ran in a specific folder to your exploit is the python server. This is because it is what is serving that file back to the ldap. The ldap has to run in the target folder because that's where all of it's dependencies are. FYI the flag folders are only there to help you stay organized. If you wanted, you could run every single flag in the same one. 

You payload is a very important part of this and it very much has to be correct. I very much recommend the hackersploit video before ever touching this project, especially flag 2. 

Source: it is the video that made me understand the exploit and how it all works.

That definitely answered my questioned, Kevin! Although, I'm encountering an issue where despite using my IP address after using 'ip a'. I still am unable to reverse-connect into the target. I'm modeling my approach after the hackersploit video, but no address is working. 

Is this possibly due to my malicious payload? Disregard, working on syntax

Should I go back tweak it around or is there some other command I am not aware of? Disregard, see above info block

I would have thought using my localhost address would have revealed something but no luck. Any other ideas? 

I can confirm that I have tried other addresses to perform the ldap lookup similar to the hacksploit video, but no luck with them either.

EDIT: I can verify that I am using the correct port as mentioned in your video and the hackersploit because of the logic you were conveying. Can't exactly the specifics, but I hope this conveys enough sense to all.

EDIT: Is it recommended to import anything or stick to what was strictly given in the template? Disregard, I am trying what I see in the hackersploit video.

EDIT: It also should be mentioned that I am just getting the html of the target outputted back to me, but no connection is established. To be more technical, I'm getting success code 200, but no actual connection to the target server.

EDIT: Getting something in my listener, when I copy and paste my ip and port in my browser but nothing when I use curl.

Just to verify, this flag is possible to complete this flag with the 127.0.0.1 address and requested port right? After reading the directions again, I realize we need to use similar syntax from flag 1 and intro flag. However, I'm getting unreadable characters. I feel the new resource sharing thread talked about this but I cannot find. Anyone else getting weird characters?

Thanks Kevin for the Office Hours! Definitely going to step as I swear I've been feeling the hackersploit video and I understand what is going behind the scenes.

I remember you mentioned how we have to make our python server and netcat listener 'talk' to each other. This is the part I realize I'm stuck on cause nothing is popping up in my python server despite my netcat listener spewing out garbage characters. Is there a header we can use to make this possible or accomodate this? 

Going to walk away from this and actually sleep for the day but any ideas on what I should look more closely at? I don't wanna explain too much as they may violate the policies enforced by TAs but there has to be something I'm missing.

EDIT (typing on my phone so please excuse the bad grammar): Just had a thought. I know it’s not recommended to change the IP address of the marshalsec server but if I remember correctly from the Hackersploit video, the IP used to host needs to be our own. However, the IP listed in the write up is not mine. Was this something meant to be looked over and edited?

Not quite. The flow of execution is curl with payload injection -> ldap -> python server -> java code -> back to vulnerable web server. Once the vulnerable web server gets your exploit file THEN it executes the code to get your reverse shell to the ncat listener. 

So the python server doesn't directly talk to the ncat listener. If the ncat listener is spewing out garbage characters but the python server isn't logging anything, then I'm guessing you are somehow calling the ncat listener in your curl, which is not how this works. 

Sounds good, it is always good to walk away and get some fresh perspective. 

I recommend not changing any of the ports or IP addresses unless you really understand how they all work and are connected. If there is an IP in the write up, you should go with that.

Got it, I’ll try again when I’m back from work regarding keeping everything the same. Just to clarify, from the write up of flag1, we are using the docker IP to conduct this attack, not our vm ip? 

Just wanna say too, thank you again for sticking with this, I just wanna make sure that I’m on the right track because I won’t lie, I feel so behind by trying to learn all this for the first time and hitting so many dead ends makes me feel like I’m going insane. I truly appreciate you scaffolding and working at my beginner level. 😅

EDIT: I think something is clicking, however, redact any of this content that I will say if necessary. We need to perform the curl using the following information very similar to flag1. Then, using a similar approach that we did in that flag, we need to perform a look up to the IP mentioned to use in flag1 and port hosting our exploit. Do I have that correct?

No problem, this can be a lot to learn if it is the first time you are seeing this stuff. I think that would be a good thing to try. 

The curl will be as stated in the write up, with your payload injection in the attack vector if that makes sense.

Okay so status update:

When running the ip of the marshalsec server along with the port since both are hosting the Exploit class, I am seeing communication between my listening port and ldap referer and no garbage data! However, the connection immediately ends. I'm also seeing a different ip pop up when communication occurs. (IP used is the marshalsec's but not the one I'm seeing).

In previous attempts, I would change my Exploit to be this mysterious address but the same thing would keep repeating. Is there a reason why?

Nice work! So it sounds like you are requesting the ldap through the curl, the ldap is calling the python server, and the server is serving your java file back to the vulnerable app? If this is the case, you should be seeing "Entering Exploit" in the logs. If that's the case, congrats you have the hard part figured out. 

If all of the above is correct, then your java code is not quite right and the command isn't getting a reverse shell. You will need to tweak this I assume.

Interesting.. What if I do not see the message 'Entering Exploit' in the logs? Does this also mean that my java code needs to be tweaked again? Or does it still have something to do with my ldap call? I'm going review the hackersploit again because I saw I used the code and logic behind the code correctly. Will update upon something new happening.

Yup! Will do! It took a bit, It should be there whenever you have a chance. Thank you again Kevin! I feel like there has to be some sort mismatch. Just to make sure I have this right:

The <redacted> is what we are using to exploit the endpoint in this. This helps us simulate remote user endpoint management and how we can reverse-shell connect to another user via JNDI lookup. After all, it has the class file.

The Python Server (Ldap Referer) uses port 4242 as described in the writeup as this retrieving our exploit file from the JNDI lookup.

The marshalsec uses the IP sent to it and the same port for communication to relay ldap lookups of our exploit.class file. It will then listen on a different port that we can use to perform our curl to reach the vulnerable web server requested in the write.

Our netcat listener relays information via reverse-shell connection from our exploit.class file which is why we supply the port and correct IP in the exploit.class.

How am I doing so far with this take on the matter?

Okay, I have taken a look at everything and everything you have is working as expected. I see your servers are both logging happy and your java exploit is being returned (No logging because you don't have a print statement in there, it can be helpful for you if you add one). 

With that said, the issue lies in your java file itself. Look for alternatives to the command you are executing. The command you are running might not be installed on the vulnerable web server ;)

I will say, If you aren't receiving any traffic, there's something going with the way you have your servers and listener configured. That's how I was stuck on it for a couple days.

I'd work from where you left off from flag1 as this is a simple jndi lookup. The Hackersploit actually says everything you need to do. Just be careful with how you execute the bash terminal.

If your listener terminates immediately like it did for me, it could be your java file is not setup correctly which is where things messed up for me. 

I wish I could say more but then I feel I'd probably be in violation of the policies enforced by TAs. 

I hate to say 'trust me bro', but trust me when I say  that as long as your steps are one-to-one to the instructions from the flag 2 writeup, then its just a matter figuring out your java and see what the Hackersploit dude does to reach his goal.

I think I am stuck in a similar spot to some others, but haven't had much luck. I have tried a few different ports, but I just seem to be logging the jndi request in the header rather than it actually running. Using the same syntax as the intro flag and flag1, so feel like it's probably safe to say it has to do with my ports or the exploit?

It is very likely due to your port if you jndi injection is correct. You need to pay close attention to the ports of each server, and think about which server you are wanting your jndi request to hit.

I think you need to take a step back and better understand the exploit. I strongly do not recommend you do this via trial and error.

Haven't found any way to test commands without having to modify and recompile the exploit file.

I have all of my servers up and running, and I call a curl command with an exploit. My LDAP server gets hit, and says "Send ... redirecting to http...Exploit.class", just like in the walkthrough video. But my python server does not get any requests. Any advice would be appreciated.

I have verified many times that the ports are the same, and that the ldap server is reaching out to the exact python address:port

I have compiled my java file

I verified that the python server is available by going to the port:ip of my python server in chrome, and it works fine there

I copy the output of the ldap server, paste it in chrome, and my java file gets downloaded

Is the exploit I am sending through curl incorrect somehow? Im at a complete loss

Hmm, it could be that your payload injection isn't quite right. If your python server is not logging anything, then that likely is the case. You can verify this by seeing if the logs have "Reference class: foo:" in them where your payload injection was. That means that the request to the ldap was unexpected aka incorrect.

So, the one thing I notice is that your port doesn't appear correct. Please keep in mind what port each of these servers are running on, and which one you need to call first in your exploit. I recommend looking closer at the steps of execution of this exploit, and use the port of the first one called. I think you are on the dot other than the port. 


I am thinking you teapot error is coming from the /error resource, which is a built in feature of spring boot. If you scroll up further to the /rest/cartoons/isAlive call, I would assume no error there.

Hmm, is it logging anything? Can you confirm the app is running? You might need to Stop/Start container.

I feel like I'm doing everything correctly and I see my request in the log, but afterwards it looks like it doesn't make it to the LDAP server. I haven't changed anything and I've restarted and done this step by step several times. I understand the flow and the purpose of each of these, but I don't understand why the request is not being forwarded to the LDAP server.

If you are not hitting the ldap server, then your injection is not correct. It could be IP, port etc. I would recommend checking out the hacksploit video again and following along very closely.

I followed everything right down to the escape characters he used and tried every IP address and hostname I know about in this context along with the LDAP port. I see my input on the main server but it never sends any requests to the LDAP server. I know that my payload is correct because I can make requests directly to the python server, but I know that's not where they're supposed to go.

OK, it just started working with one IP address that I've tried multiple times. This is very buggy.

Hmm let me clarify. The process flow is: curl -> vulnerable webapp -> ldap -> python -> exploit. So the payload injection in your curl should be requesting the ldap server.

I'm able to open a reverse shell after I call the isAlive endpoint with my GATECH_ID as a  header in the curl request. When I execute the jar file, I get:

Your gatechId has not been set on server. This is set for you automatically via GATECH_ID header. Refer to write up how to properly call application and retry.

Not sure why I am receiving this error since I'm passing my Georgia Tech id as the header.

I have the curl -> webserver and payload redirecting to jndi to the python web server and it is opening a session with the netcat server (confirmed with the ps -ef also). However, I don't get an interactive shell similar to the screenshot on the instruction or the flag. 

Some guidance to direct me on the things to check, please?

Looks like nc -e is not longer works. What is an alternative way to open the remote shell?

For some of it, I have got the point why Webserver is now going to the netcat server, but the message I see says connection received from an IP address of the docker container instead of my localhost. Expected is the shell which is not happening.

This should all happen under the hood by executing your malicious curl. I do recommend the hackersploit video in the linked resources for this flag. It is almost exactly what you need for this flag and really lays out the concepts of how this exploit happens.

Not a dumb question at all. The VM IP is localhost (127.0.0.1) and the application is running on the docker network at 172.17.0.1. You will need to determine which one you need as part of this learning outcome.

Is there a trick to getting nc to open a connection? I can execute my Java test and see the correct output from my script (Just testing whoami and returning the string) in the console, but nothing in the nc window. I'm opening with 

nc -nlvp 9999
Do we need to establish sockets in the exploit?

The curl command should not directly call the LDAP server. 

Your curl command should be sent to the vulnerable application (localhost:8080). The application should then make the LDAP call as part of the exploit. I'd suggest going through the linked resources to understand how the different components work.

My curl command is directly calling localhost:8080, I am using the vulnerability to make the LDAP call. I have gone through all linked resources, except the last video on "Exploitation and Mitigation" which I am watching now.  Flag 2 mentions any System.out.println statements in our Java file should show up in console.log, without any further configuration.

When running my curl command, I am seeing that it attempts to make the desired LDAP call but has a 400 error. To debug this, I am trying to see what happens when it is trying to execute the code in my Java file, but I see nothing in console.log, even when I reduce it to just 1 print statement each in the try catch.

Currently hitting a roadblock and not finding anything to point in the direction of what the cause is.

I seem to be making the connections, but the python http server is printing out code 400, message Bad HTTP/0.9 request type ('0').  I confirm using the same command for the LDAP server as provided in the setup guide.

I'm a bit confused on the role of the python http server command within the context of this flag. Should curl be used for the jndi lookup, and is the intention that this lookup would then reference the java file?

To answer your question, yes. For a much better picture - on the homepage of the Log4Shell project GitHub, you find a diagram in the background section that can be very helpful visually. Here the python http server is the malicious server (see the setup section as well for more details). Finally, this resource (from the Important Reference Materials) is highly recommended for this flag - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJeAgQQaDEw
